FINDINGS: Exam is limited by patient positioning in extreme neck flexion. Mild compression deformities of the superior endplates of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies, without fracture line evident. These are difficult to age at CT but may be chronic. No other fracture. Several millimeters of anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and mild anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and of C5 on C6. Advanced multilevel facet arthrosis. A central disc protrusion or extrusion at C3-4 contributes along with the spondylolisthesis and posterior ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding to spinal canal stenosis and probably moderate compression of the spinal cord. Ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding is notable also at a few other levels, particularly at C2-3. Neural foraminal stenosis is advanced at left C3-4 and moderate at right C3-4. On initial scanning, at the level of C3 to the inferior endplate of C4, there was apparent hyperdensity within the spinal canal, circumferentially about the cord (for example series 8, image 47). The patient was brought back for additional scanning given the indeterminate nature of the hyperdensity after discussion with Andrea Hlady, MD, PhD (pager #11001).

Radiation therapy completed 05/25/2022. Steroid therapy tapered to dexamethasone 1 mg QD on 10/07/2022.

Followup imaging here on November 16, 2022, confirmed tumor progression, and thus her second course of 10 fractions of radiation therapy was initiated on November 18, 2022, with completion in early December 2022. FINDINGS: Since the most recent prior examination of 11/16/2022, there has been substantial improvement in overall degree of expansion of the pons as well as spatial extent of T2 hyperintensity within the pons and superior medulla with slight interval decrease in size of the previously seen exophytic component arising from the left ventrolateral inferior pons. Overall appearance of the pons is now more similar to findings on the 08/26/2022 examination with similar appearance of the 4th ventricle which is less severely compressed than on the November exam. Previously seen prominent T1 hypointensity within the central pons noted on the November scan has resolved with the overall appearance on postcontrast T1-weighted images now appearing more similar to the August 26 examination with areas of subtle linear enhancement traversing the central and lateral pons. Overall dimensions of the mid pons as measured on image 10 series 5 at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncles is approximately 4.3 cm transverse by approximately 2.5 cm AP with comparable measurement on the earlier November scan measuring 4.6 cm transverse by 8.0 cm AP as measured on comparable anatomic image 9 of series 6 of the November scan. The change in the spatial extent of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity is most evident when comparing sagittal T2 FLAIR images slightly to the left of midline including the exophytic inferior pontine ventral component; maximal craniocaudal dimension of the T2 FLAIR signal abnormality measured approximately 3.1 cm on the November scan compared to only 1.6 cm on the current examination as measured on image 74 series 4 and approximately 1.8 cm on the August 26 examination. Stable postsurgical changes with hemosiderin staining biopsy tract again noted traversing the left cerebellar hemisphere and left middle cerebellar peduncle with termination in the left lateral aspect of the pons, where small cystic cavity is again noted. Remainder of the brain is unremarkable with no additional pathologic intracranial enhancement seen aside from stable appearing left medial frontal developmental venous anomaly. No diffusion restriction. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells as well as orbits are unremarkable.

FINDINGS: Redemonstration of the mixed cystic and predominantly solid enhancing suprasellar glioma. The enhancing components on todays exam measure approximately 2.8 x 3.4 x 3.7 cm (AP by LR by SI) compared to 3.1 x 3.3 x 4.0 cm previously when measured in the same planes. There is notably less superior extension of the mass into the region of the third ventricle compared to the prior study with the tumor no longer encroaching upon the region of the foramina of Monro. No hydrocephalus. Furthermore, the dominant cystic portion along the inferior right aspect of the lesion adjacent to the right M1 has significantly decreased in size now measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.8 cm (AP x LR x SI) compared to 1.5 x 1.5 x 2.2 cm previously.

There is persistent increased CBV perfusion corresponding to this mass lesion. Redemonstrated is previously stereotactic biopsy tract from left occipital bone approach, with susceptibility weighted signal loss compatible with blood metabolites along the biopsy tract at the biopsy site. There are persistent areas of unenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity with mild mass effect surrounding the enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere and in the vermis, which could represent areas of edematous change versus areas of subtle unenhancing infiltrative tumor.

FINDINGS: Combination of the tumor and radiation treatment (gamma knife) protocols was utilized. Abnormal exam. Recent postoperative changes are present from a right frontal lobe approach stereotactic biopsy of the patients known right thalamic mass lesion with small amount of postoperative blood products on susceptibility weighted images along the biopsy tract and at the mass lesion (intrinsic T1 weighted images within the mass lesion). Examination reveals interval slightly progressed lobulated, heterogeneous nodular enhancement within the previously present intra-axial mass lesion in the right thalamic lobe, pathologically proven Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade 4. Immunostains are positive for GFAP, ATRX and p53 (mutation staining pattern), and negative for IDH1, CD20 and CD45. The heterogeneous areas of enhancement within the mass lesion currently measured 3.3 cm AP by 2.2 cm transverse by 2.1 cm craniocaudal, and is more confluent than November 2, 2022., At which time it measured 2.7 cm AP by 1.7 cm transverse by 1.7 cm craniocaudal when remeasured in a similar manner. There is surrounding unenhancing T2/or hyperintensity which is essentially circumscribed of the right thalamic lobe associated to this lesion. There is partial effacement of the right lateral ventricle, with approximately 2 mm subfalcine herniation of the right thalamic lobe into the left, but without evidence of associated hydrocephalus. Previously identified focus of abnormal cortical/subcortical thickening with T2/FLAIR hyperintensity is redemonstrated in the right superior parietal lobule (series 15, image 166), with increased signal on diffusion images but no evidence of true restricted diffusion. There is a faint focus of curvilinear leptomeningeal enhancement overlying this lesion (series 18, image 170), which could represent a focus of associated leptomeningeal spread of these are process or could represent a small enhancing vessel. This focus of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity is stable since November 2, 2022, but is slightly more confluent than September 19, 2022.

COMPARISON: Outside brain MRI 10/21/2022 FINDINGS: Since 10/21/2022, significant interval increase in size of the now peripherally enhancing (and centrally nonenhancing) mass in the anteromedial right temporal lobe with the enhancing component now measuring 4.3 x 3.4 x 3.8 cm (AP x RL x SI), previously measuring 1.6 x 1.3 x 1.4 cm. The enhancing tissue now extends into the right subinsular region. Furthermore, T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal about the enhancing component of the lesion has markedly increased as well with abnormal signal extending into the posterior right parahippocampal gyrus, deep posterior temporal lobe, subinsular white matter as well as involving the right basal ganglia and right internal capsule. Notably, the abnormal T2 signal does not extend across the corpus callosum nor traverse across the anterior commissure. Focally increased perfusion within the anterosuperior enhancing components of the lesion, whereas the remaining vast majority of the lesion demonstrates decreased perfusion. No associated restricted diffusion. Internal foci of susceptibility consistent with blood products. Overall mass effect results in local regional sulcal effacement, partial effacement of the right lateral ventricle, and 6 mm of leftward midline shift at the level of the septum pellucidum. There is a moderate degree of uncal herniation partially distorting the right middle cerebral peduncle. The left lateral ventricle is mildly enlarged, and has slightly increased in caliber since 10/21/2022 indicating possible early obstructive hydrocephalus versus redistribution of CSF from the now effaced right lateral ventricle. Mildly expansile T2 hyperintense signal in the subcortical left frontal lobe remains relatively stable to minimally increased since 10/21/2022. However, there is a new 2 mm nodular focus of enhancement at the gray-white junction within inferior aspect of the region of abnormal T2 signal (series 25/image 75 and series 26/image 82). Mildly increased regional perfusion. No associated restricted diffusion. Wispy linear enhancement in the superior right frontal gyrus (series 25 images 127-130 and series 26/images 72-74) not seen previously (possibly due to technical factors/motion). No associated T2 signal abnormality. This may be a benign vascular lesion given lack of associated T2 signal abnormality. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. Scattered paranasal sinus mucosal thickening. Opacification of a majority of the right mastoid and pneumatized temporal bone air cells. No calvarial or skull base lesions. Extracranial soft tissues are unremarkable. Findings were discussed with Kathy Baule APRN, DNP (24016) at 3:00 PM on 11/11/2022. IMPRESSION: 1. Rapidly enlarging infiltrative mass in the medial right temporal lobe with imaging features and temporal evolution suggestive of high-grade glioma, although metastasis cannot be excluded. This is further confounded by the relatively stable T2/FLAIR signal in the remote left frontal lobe with tiny nodule of enhancement as multifocal metastases are statistically more likely than multifocal glioma. Regardless, tissue sampling will be required for final diagnosis. 2. Locoregional mass effect resulting in 6 mm of new leftward midline shift and mild uncal herniation partially compressing the right cerebral peduncle. 3. Mildly enlarged left lateral ventricle may represent early entrapment versus CSF redistribution from the effaced right lateral ventricle.","Glioma progression"

The mass extends inferiorly along the right tentorium and abuts the superior margin of the distal right transverse sinus without substantial compression or obvious invasion. There is enhancing T2 hyperintensity extending across the splenium of the corpus callosum as well as along the medial aspect of the atrium of the right lateral ventricle and into the white matter tracts of the right occipital lobe with some associated diffusion restriction. There are prominent vascular flow voids associated with the solid peripheral portions of the mass. The mass abuts and effaces the lateral margin of the adjacent right lateral ventricle. Overall, the mass has probably slightly progressed since 07/22/2022, allowing for differences in technique. Minimal midline shift of approximately 2 mm at the level of the septum pellucidum appears similar. No substantial basilar cistern effacement.

The overall volume of the T2 hyperintense abnormality is similar to 6 days ago, but there has been some progression and further necrosis of some contrast enhancing areas since then. More specifically by location, substantial masslike T2 hyperintense abnormality throughout the left mesial temporal lobe, from uncus and amygdala through the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus and in the fusiform gyrus, and also in the white matter of the anterior left temporal lobe and temporal stem and extending into the left insula, in the left periatrial white matter, posterior left lentiform nucleus and posterior limb of the left internal capsule, the left caudothalamic groove area, in the left hypothalamus and mammillary body, and posteroinferior left thalamus. A subtle hazy area of nonenhancing T2 hyperintense signal in the right anteromesial frontal lobe (series 300 image 127) probably represents contralateral hemisphere, multifocal glioma. Focal areas of masslike contrast enhancement within the larger area of T2 hyperintense signal are generally mildly larger than 6 days ago, and two of these, within the left anterior and inferomedial temporal lobe, have become necrotic (these measure 12 and 14 mm diameter, respectively). Other smaller areas of contrast enhancement at the inferior left basal ganglia, in the left hypothalamus, the left anterior temporal stem, the posteromedial left temporal lobe, and the left middle temporal gyrus. The masslike swelling of the left temporal lobe effaces the left ambient cistern and the temporal horn of the left lateral ventricle, and the frontal horn and body of the left lateral ventricle are mildly partially effaced, new since 2016. Moderate leukoaraiosis in the cerebral hemispheric white matter and central pons. Generalized cerebral and cerebellar volume loss. IMPRESSION: Infiltrative-appearing partially contrast-enhancing abnormality centered in the left temporal lobe most likely represents a diffuse astrocytoma, most suspicious for glioblastoma.

COMPARISON: Outside functional brain MRI 3/16/2022 and outside noncontrast stereotactic head CT dated 4/11/2022 are the only images available for review at the time of interpretation. FINDINGS: Since 3/16/2022 MR, significant interval progression of expansile, T2 hyperintense signal throughout the left temporal lobe, supraorbital left frontal lobe, basal ganglia, left thalamus, and tracking across midline at the genu of the corpus callosum and fornix into the right parahippocampal gyrus, right medial temporal lobe, and right thalamus. T2 signal further tracks down the left cerebral peduncle into the midbrain and pons. Overall, these findings are consistent with infiltrating glial tumor. These components of the tumor do not demonstrate restricted diffusion or decreased ADC values. However, there is a new focus of restricted diffusion within the lateral left pons that demonstrates mild associated mass effect and appears contiguous with the tract of abnormal T2 signal tracking along the left midbrain and pons. There is no associated enhancement. While an acute infarct could appear similar, this appearance is favored to represent a highly cellular component of the glial tumor. Overall, supratentorial mass effect from the infiltrative neoplastic process results in 8 mm of midline shift at the level of the foramen of Monro which has progressed 4/11/2022 when there was 5 mm of midline shift. Midline shift results in near complete effacement of the third ventricle with interval increase in the caliber of the lateral ventricles, greater on the right, consistent with developing obstructive hydrocephalus. Furthermore, further effacement of the basilar cisterns, more notably in the region of the interpeduncular fossa with distortion of the lateral midbrain bilaterally represents some component of developing uncal herniation. Crowding of the cerebellar tonsils in the region of the foramen magnum is also increased consistent with increasing intracranial pressure. New somewhat nodular leptomeningeal enhancement tracking along the left sylvian fissure and the left middle cerebral artery (series 900/image 114) and along the supraorbital left frontal marginal gyrus leptomeninges (series 900/ image 111) is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma.

FINDINGS: Redemonstrated expansile partially exophytic brainstem glioma predominantly in the right medulla and lower pons and medulla with extension of T2 signal abnormality into the right cerebellar flocculus inferiorly and right middle cerebellar peduncle posteriorly. No appreciable change in extent of T2 signal abnormality at the margins of the lesion. However, a focal, more hyperintense component of the abnormality in the right medulla has increased since 1/28/2022 and 10/14/2021 (series 5 image 9 today compared to series 6 image 9 on 01/28/2022 and series 6 image 8 on 10/14/2021). Mildly increased volume of some subcentimeter enhancing nodules within the larger T2 hyperintense abnormality since 01/28/2022. No new remote foci of pathologic parenchymal enhancement. Associated mass effect on the adjacent basilar cisterns is unchanged. Stable normal ventricular caliber. Stable postoperative changes of right retrosigmoid approach for brainstem tumor debulking and biopsy. Similar punctate focus of susceptibility artifact in the central medulla. No abnormal intracranial diffusion restriction. Major intracranial vascular flow voids are preserved. Similar total opacification left maxillary sinus and patchy partial opacification/mucosal thickening of the left greater than right ethmoid air cells. Mastoids are well aerated. IMPRESSION: Continued mild interval increase in size of enhancing nodules within the known brainstem glioma, concerning for progression.","Glioma progression"

Again seen is diffuse predominantly nonenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense infiltrative tumor along the cortex of the left frontal lobe and along the left sylvian fissure and insular cortex. Overall, the extent of T2/FLAIR hyperintense nonenhancing burden is similar to the prior exam, except for slight progression within the right parietal lobe as seen on series 7 image 129, with mild increase in posterior extent. Again seen are multiple areas of enhancement, with the dominant right corona radiata enhancing lesion best seen on series 22 image 127. Additional scattered enhancing foci within the mid and posterior body of the corpus callosum, along the left mesial frontal lobe, within the left corona radiata, with scattered foci involving bilateral frontal parietal vertices as well. Persistent enhancement into the left aspect of the midbrain, involving the posterior aspect of the left cerebral peduncle. When comparing coronal postcontrast imaging, there has likely been interval increase in the extent of the contrast enhancement within the right corona radiata, measuring approximately 3.3 cm in greatest craniocaudal extent as seen on series 24 image 97, measuring approximately 3.3 cm, versus 2.3 cm previously on series 23 image 89 of the 2/14/2022 study.

Nonenhancing, confluent T2 signal hyperintensity along the margins of the anteromedial right frontal resection bed and extending across the callosal genu to the left frontal periventricular white matter is not detectably changed in comparison with the most recent study of 06/06/2020. However, this demonstrates gradual progression when comparing across serial examinations dating back to 09/14/2021. This may represent evolving postoperative gliosis. However, very gradual progression of nonenhancing glioma remains an alternate possibility, particularly given involvement of the corpus callosum and left frontal lobe.

Findings suggest that the patient may have experienced recent intraventricular hemorrhage involving the left lateral ventricle. It is advised that the patient undergo noncontrast head CT (with appropriate lead shielding of her gravid uterus) to better characterize whether the abnormality within the body of the left lateral ventricle is an organized clot. In addition, lumbar puncture for CSF analysis would be useful. #2. Intracranial MRA and MRV are negative. FINDINGS: MRI HEAD: An approximate 0.7 cm area of lobulated T1 shortening is identified within the body of the left lateral ventricle. This demonstrates blooming on the gradient-echo sequence raising concern for the presence of hemosiderin. There also appears to be some asymmetric magnetic susceptibility within the choroid plexus of the left lateral ventricle. Although a punctate focus of susceptibility in the occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle is nonspecific, there appears to be susceptibility lining the ependyma within the left occipital horn and also within the left frontal horn. This constellation of findings raises concern for the presence of previous intraventricular hemorrhage. Since IV contrast was not not administered due to the patients pregnancy, it is not entirely clear whether the lobulated abnormality in the left lateral ventricle is organized clot versus potentially a small hemorrhagic mass based along the septum pellucidum. A noncontrast head CT might be useful in making this distinction. No hydrocephalus is present. On the FLAIR sequence, there is no evidence of gross subarachnoid hemorrhage, though there may be a tiny amount of blood or proteinaceous material dependently in the occipital horns. Incidental note is made of the anatomic variant of partially empty sella. INTRACRANIAL MRA: Intracranial arteries appear normal. No evidence of aneurysm. With attention directed to the left lateral ventricle, there is no evidence of enlarged choroidal branches to conclusively suggest the presence of abnormal arteriovenous shunting. Bright signal within the body of the left lateral ventricle and in the left choroid plexus is related to intrinsic T1 shortening rather than representing flow-related enhancement. INTRACRANIAL MRV: No evidence of dural sinus thrombosis. The loss of signal within the distal transverse and sigmoid sinuses bilaterally is likely related to de-phasing. There is no abnormal signal in these areas on the FLAIR sequences to suggest the presence of thrombus. TECHNIQUE: Before taking the patient into the MRI suite, I had a detailed discussion with the patient and her husband regarding the fact that the neurology service has requested MR imaging of her head in the context of a second trimester pregnancy. I explained under these circumstances we would not be administering any intravenous contrast. We discussed that there are no large randomized controlled trials to unequivocally document the safety of MRI during the second trimester of pregnancy because of these types of studies using healthy subjects cannot be ethically performed. However, there is no compelling evidence that noncontrast MRI in gravid patients, including the population undergoing dedicated fetal MRI, has a deleterious effect on the fetus. Given the slight uncertainty that still exists because of lack of large prospective randomized controlled trials, I explained that we scrutinize all requests for MRI during pregnancy to make certain that this imaging modality is being used in a judicious fashion. In her case, the presence of a new severe headache raises concern for a number of acute intracranial processes which could potentially be life-threatening. As a result, based on the evaluation of potential benefits versus minimal theoretical risk, the patient and her husband requested that we proceed with performing the MRI. Brain MRI was performed using sagittal T1, axial T2, axial diffusion, axial gradient echo, and 3D CUBE FLAIR sequences. Axial 3D time of flight intracranial MRA was performed. Sagittal phase contrast MRV was acquired. Maximum intensity projection images of the vascular imaging were generated.

Constellation of findings on the most recent CT scans most likely represent sequela of intracranial hemorrhage status post fall. Clinical findings discussed with Dr. Holtz by telephone at 1509 on 8/9/2016. Findings also discussed with Dr. Singh in person at 1536 on 8/9/2016. FINDINGS: Limited exam due to patient cooperativity; patient refused to complete post gadolinium images. Limited imaging show a right-sided subdural collection. This is T1 low/intermediate intensity and T2/FLAIR low/intermediate intensity. This does not show restricted diffusion. In greatest axial depth this measures 6-7 mm. There are 6 mm of right to left midline shift. The basilar cisterns are widely patent; no uncal herniation. Allowing for differences in modality, this appears to have increased since 7/25/2016, when it was relatively inconspicuous, and is not definitely seen 7/24/2016. By imaging and temporal characteristics, this probably represents subacute subdural hematoma. Slow venous bleeding is difficult to exclude given the change over time. Previously noted free flowing intraventricular hemorrhage appears to have resolved. Ventricular caliber is stable respect to the prior exam; no new hydrocephalus. T2 signal and blooming in the anteromedial left temporal lobe consistent with sequela of small intraparenchymal hematoma. Small nodule again seen along the epididymal surface of the frontal horn of left lateral ventricle. This is T2 hyperintense and show susceptibility on gradient images and may represent a calcified subpleural nodule (series 6/9, image 28). Although findings are not specific for this probably represents an area of residual hemosiderin in the setting of recent intraventricular blood; calcified subpleural nodule is not excluded although less favored is this would be an uncommon finding to develop in a patient of this age.

Resultant commensurate increase in the mass effect on the adjacent cerebral cortex results in essentially complete effacement of the left lateral ventricle and 3rd ventricle, and 1.6 cm of rightward midline shift at the level of the septum pellucidum. 1.2 cm of rightward transfalcine herniation and partial effacement of the left basilar cisterns concerning for early transtentorial herniation. The right lateral ventricle is dilated, particularly the temporal horn, trigone, and occipital horn consistent with ventricular entrapment. No convincing evidence of established infarct. Smaller component of subdural hematoma along the right parietal convexity measuring 3 mm in radial diameter. Additional subdural blood products along the falx and tentorial leaflets. Increased attenuation within the left sylvian fissure and subarachnoid space, as well as those along the vascular structures of the basal cisterns are likely related to the use of intravenous and enteric contrast earlier today rather than interval development of subarachnoid blood products, although this is not entirely excluded. Secretions within the posterior nasopharynx. No cranial or facial fractures. Minimal scattered paranasal sinus mucosal thickening. Mastoid air cells are well aerated. IMPRESSION: Enlarging large acute subdural hematoma along the left cerebral convexity with significant mass effect resulting in 1.6 cm of rightward midline shift with associated transfalcine and probable uncal herniation. Complete effacement of the left lateral ventricle and 3rd ventricle with resultant entrapment and dilation of the right lateral ventricle.

FINDINGS: Large, lobulated infiltrative mass within the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum, which measures 6 x 5.9 x 5.3 cm (AP x TR x CC series 5, image 48 and se7/im30). No upstream bowel dilatation to suggest obstruction. Multiple surrounding soft tissue nodules consistent with local regional metastases, the largest of which is located anterior to the mass and measures 1.2 cm the superior margin of the mass abuts the inferior aspect of the distal pancreatic body/tail. The fat plane is maintained along the majority of the superior margin of the mass, however there are a couple focal areas of soft tissue bridging that may represent metastatic extension to the pancreas (series 7 image 34 and 36). The medial aspect of the mass abuts the proximal SMA, with probable involvement of the vessel wall up to 50%. The lateral and posterior origins of the mass are mostly bounded by the bowel wall, which appears mostly intact other than areas of hazy stranding into the mesenteric fat. Multiple surrounding enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Hazy infiltrative appearance of a lymph node/soft tissue metastasis located between the aorta and IVC measuring approximately 3.3 cm (series 5 image 35). Scattered omental nodularity suggesting metastatic involvement, for example a 1.4 cm nodule on series 5 image 89 and 8 mm nodule on series 5 image 69. No pneumoperitoneum or fluid in the abdomen and pelvis. Additional 3 x 3.7 x 5.2 cm hypodense soft tissue mass between the IVC and duodenum abuts the main portal vein superiorly. This likely represents additional metastatic lesion. Multiple hypodense lesions within the liver likely also represent metastatic involvement. The largest of these is located in segment 8 and measures 2.8 x 3.5 cm with multiple smaller satellite hypodensity surrounding this lesion. The portal veins and hepatic veins remain patent. A few scattered pulmonary micronodules (<3 mm), for example in the medial left lower lobe on series 6 images 18 and 40. Larger 7 mm nodular opacity in the inferior most left lower lobe (series 6 image 73). Borderline splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 13.2 cm. Negative adrenal glands.

Scattered, bilateral pulmonary nodules, with a predilection for the pleural surfaces and lung periphery.

There is a 7 mm lytic lesion at the inferior angle of the right scapula without associated fracture. No overlying soft tissue abnormality. This probably accounts for patients pain. 2. Multiple other lytic lesions, some associated with fracture, including the bilateral ribs, right clavicular head, and T5 vertebral body. 3. There is a 2.5 cm consolidation within the right upper lobe; this has likely been stable since at least 3/31/2017. Appearance is typical of fungal infection such as coccidioidomycosis. Recommend correlation with prior cross-sectional imaging. If none is available, correlation with coccidioidomycosis titers and CT follow-up in 3-6 months could be performed. CLINICAL HISTORY: Right scapular pain; history of multiple myeloma. CT THORAX WITH IV DYE TECHNIQUE: Overlapping axial images are reconstructed through the chest following a single breath hold helical acquisition. Iodinated contrast was administered intravenously; see PowerChart for the amounts and type of iodinated contrast media administered and wasted. 3-D images including sagittal multiplanar reconstructions and axial maximum intensity projection reconstructions were performed on the scanner under general physician supervision. These reconstructions were performed to clarify relevant anatomy as well as to increase sensitivity for pulmonary nodules. COMPARISON: Skeletal survey, 5/3/2018; bone survey, 3/31/2017. FINDINGS: Bones: There is a 7 mm lytic lesion at the inferior angle of the right scapula. No associated fracture. Prior anterolateral right second, lateral left fourth, and lateral left fifth rib fracture; there are associated lytic lesions with the left-sided rib fractures, suggesting multiple myeloma involvement. Large lytic lesion of the right clavicular head with associated fracture. Lytic lesion at the left posterior lateral aspect of the T5 vertebral body. Ossific nonunion of the T8 spinous process tip; congenital versus sequela of prior trauma. No associated lytic lesion. Chest Wall: No lymphadenopathy. Abdomen: Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable. Mediastinum: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. No mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. No pericardial abnormality. Right internal jugular port with tip at cavoatrial junction. Pleura: No significant pleural abnormality. Lungs: There is a 25 x 14 mm consolidation within the right upper lobe with adjacent satellite nodularity (series 3, image #32). In retrospect, this is likely present on prior skeletal survey (3/31/2017). Given the differences of modality, this is difficult to categorize as completely stable. Appearance is typical of granulomatous infection such as coccidioidomycosis. There is an associated perihilar calcified lymph node. There multiple other, smaller nodes, predominantly in a centrilobular distribution, noted throughout the lungs. For example, a 5 mm nodule in the anterior right upper lobe (series 3, image #48) and a 4 mm lymph node within the left lower lobe (series 3, image #81). The lungs are otherwise clear, no pneumonia or edema. No significant pleural fluid or pneumothorax identified.

Consolidation in the posterior right lower lobe. Findings are likely inflammatory or infectious but should be followed to resolution to exclude an underlying lesion. 3. Possible left intracapsular implant rupture, poorly evaluated with CT. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for implant integrity. 4. Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy, not significant setting of infection. This can be followed up at the time of repeat CT. The results of this examination and recommendations were discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Lew at 7:55 PM via telephone. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray March 13, 2016. CT chest August 24, 2015. FINDINGS: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Heart is normal in size. Again seen are partially calcified mediastinal lymph nodes, likely from prior granulomatous infection. There is mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy, slightly increased from prior CT. For example, there is a right paratracheal lymph node measuring 0.2 cm short axis (series 5, image 49) and a precarinal lymph node measuring 11 mm short axis (image 53). Mild left hilar adenopathy measuring up to 7 mm short axis, not significantly changed (image 64). No axillary lymphadenopathy. Esophagus collapsed and poorly evaluated. Apical scarring in bronchiectasis not significantly changed. There is ground glass opacification in the right middle lobe, measuring 2.7 cm craniocaudad (series 6B, image 70). There are multifocal groundglass nodules in the right lower lobe with consolidation posteriorly. There are also multifocal groundglass opacities in the base of the left lower lobe. Basilar opacities were seen on the comparison CT. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild degenerative changes in the lower thoracic spine. Contour deformity of the posterolateral right ninth and 10th ribs is likely from prior fractures. Bilateral breast implants again noted.

Images of the abdomen were also obtained given the patients known abdominal aortic aneurysm. COMPARISON: Retroperitoneal ultrasound 12/04/2012. Chest radiograph 04/07/2008. SUMMARY: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. No penetrating aortic ulcer or aortic dissection. 3. No significant visualized coronary artery stenosis, although evaluation is limited secondary to coronary artery calcifications. 4. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3 cm, minimally enlarged versus stable from the ultrasound of 12/04/2012 given differences in modality/technique. 5. Indeterminate pulmonary nodules. See follow-up guidelines below. 6. Small right adrenal nodule likely represents an adenoma, but is technically indeterminate. Dedicated CT or MRI may be helpful for further evaluation. FINDINGS: The exam is negative for acute aortic dissection or acute aortic injury. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.0 cm (series 5 image 138). This measures slightly larger than the comparison ultrasound, but may be secondary to differences in modality/technique. No CT evidence of aneurysmal rupture. Due to delayed scanning of the abdomen, the patency of the abdominal aorta and its visceral branches is not well evaluated on this exam, however there does appear to be any gross marked stenosis. Moderate aortoiliac atherosclerotic disease. CORONARY ARTERIES: Evaluation of patency of the coronary arteries is limited secondary to coronary artery calcification. Dominance: Right coronary artery dominance. Left Main Coronary: Mild plaque without significant stenosis. Left Anterior Descending: Mild to moderate atherosclerotic plaque without significant stenosis, although atherosclerotic calcification limits visualization. The 1st and 2nd diagonal branches appear patent. Left circumflex: Moderate atherosclerotic plaque without significant stenosis, although calcification limits visualization. The 1st obtuse marginal is patent. Right coronary artery: Moderate atherosclerotic plaque with possible moderate narrowing (less than 70 %) of the proximal and mid RCA. The distal RCA and visualized 1st marginal branch appear patent. No gross regional wall motion abnormalities on cine images. Mild thinning of the myocardium at the cardiac apex. No gross visualized perfusion defects of the myocardium. Mild thickening of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: Emphysematous changes in the lungs, most marked in the upper lobes. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The tracheobronchial tree is patent. Linear scarring in the lingula. There are several small indeterminate pulmonary nodules in both lungs, the largest of which measures 5 mm in the anterior right middle lobe (series 4 image 163), and 5-6 mm in the lateral right lower lobe (series 4 image 150), and 5 mm in the lateral left lower lobe (series 4 image 181). Diffuse hepatic steatosis. Low-attenuation nodule within the right adrenal gland (series 5 image 73) most likely represents a adrenal adenoma, but is technically indeterminate (Hounsfield units 34). Contrast within the renal collecting systems secondary to mild delay in scanning of the abdomen. Tortuosity of the mid right ureter from a apparent crossing vessel without evidence of obstruction.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph 01/11/2016. Outside institution thoracic MRI angiogram 03/23/2015. SUMMARY: 1. No pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or significant coronary artery stenosis. 2. Aneurysmal dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 46 mm. 3. Small penetrating ulcer of the proximal descending thoracic aorta. FINDINGS: No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The findings on the chest radiograph from earlier today may have been secondary to slight distortion of the mediastinal contents secondary to aneurysmal dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta detailed below. Aneurysmal dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta which measures up to 46 mm in diameter on double oblique axial measurements (series 215) at the level of the main pulmonary artery, similar to the comparison MRI given differences in technique/modality.

No pericardial abnormality. . Pleura: No pleural abnormality. Abdomen: Visualized upper abdomen largely unremarkable. Please see recent dedicated abdominal imaging reports where applicable. Lungs: Patchy opacity is present in the right upper lobe consistent with the findings seen at recent CT. Heart: Myocardial contractility appears normal with no regional wall motion abnormalities although assessment is limited by gating artifact. Left ventricular wall thickness appears normal. Valvular function appears normal with no regurgitation. No evidence of scar on delayed enhancement imaging. 9 mm focus is present on series 14, correlating with the appearance on dynamic perfusion, series 102 image 211, showing some mobility, fairly near the septum. This finding may also be present series 100 image 125. The finding is not well seen on long inversion time imaging. Some additional nodular foci are present more cranially, towards the cranial septum on the right ventricular side on the same image, also image 106. Right ventricle is probably at least mildly dilated. Additional review by Dr. Marcotte: TEST INDICATION: tissue characterization of right ventricular mass in patient with CMML and increasing dyspnea.

Inversion-recovery gradient-recalled echo late Gd enhancement study in SAX \T\ 4ch long axis views. DESCRIPTION: Chart review revealed prior echo imaging stud yesterday showing findings of polylobulated right ventricular mass on echo with severe tricuspid regurgitation suggesting RV systolic pressure of 72 mmHg, bubble contrast study suggesting small intra-pulmonary shunt but no atrial septal defect and Optison suggesting partial mass enhancement. Contrast-enhanced CT showed evidence of bilateral segmental and sub-segmental pulmonary emboli. There is usual atrio-visceral arrangement with left-sided heart and apex. The systemic venous return drains normally (inferior caval vein 26 mm, superior caval vein 21 mm) to a severely-dilated right atrium (end-systolic area 28 cm2 and volume 63 ml/m2) with intact interatrial septum. The tricuspid valve appears normal with probable mild central regurgitation. The right ventricle is mild to moderately dilated with mild to moderate global systolic dysfunction but intact interventricular septum, presenting a normal curvature. Ill-defined, polylobular mobile right ventricular intracavitary masses are suspected, appearing isointense to myocardium in cinematic, T2w STIR and T1w spin echo. Gadolinium enhanced first-pass perfusion study and late enhancement images suggest no uptake, in keeping with thrombus. In comparison to the echo images, the mass bulk appears less although caution must be exerted in trans-modality comparison with different spatial and temporal resolution. The quantitative values measured for the right ventricle are as follows: Right ventricular ejection fraction: 41% Right ventricular end-diastolic volume: 301 ml (139 ml/m2) Right ventricular end-systolic volume: 178 ml (82 ml/m2) Right ventricular ejection volume: 123 ml/beat Cardiac index: 4.48 l/min/m2 The right ventricular outflow tract appears patent with grossly normal pulmonary valve function. The central pulmonary artery dimensions appear at upper limits of normal (main 29.5 mm, right 21 mm, left 21.5mm) with suspicion of intraluminal segmental filling defects as seen by contrast-enhanced CT. No pleural effusion is seen with a tiny pericardial effusion anterior to the right ventricle. No mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal nodules or masses are seen. The pulmonary venous return drains normally to a severely-dilated left atrium (end-systolic antero-posterior diameter 41 mm and volume 95 ml/m2) with no thrombus seen. The mitral valve appears normal with no regurgitation seen. The left ventricular volumes, systolic function and mass appear normal with no regional wall motion abnormality or thrombus. No pre-contrast myocardial signal abnormality was seen. There was no evidence of abnormal late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE). The quantitative values measured for the left ventricle are as follows: Left ventricular ejection fraction: 54% Left ventricular end-diastolic volume: 194 ml (90 ml/m2) Left ventricular end-systolic volume: 89 ml (41 ml/m2) Left ventricular ejection volume: 105 ml/beat Cardiac index: 3.83 l/min/m2 Left ventricular mass: 181 g (84 g/m2) The left ventricular outflow tract appears patent with grossly normal aortic valve function. The thoracic aortic dimensions appear normal with no evidence of aneurysm or coarctation. Representative measurements of the thoracic aorta are as follows: Sinuses of Valsalva: 35.5 mm Tubular ascending aorta: 36.5 mm Distal ascending aorta: 31.5 mm Proximal descending aorta: 26.5 mm Mid-descending aorta: 26 mm Pre-diaphragmatic aorta: 27 mm. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Ill-defined, polylobular mobile right ventricular intracavitary masses are suspected, appearing isointense to myocardium in cinematic, T2w STIR and T1w spin echo. Gadolinium enhanced first-pass perfusion study and late enhancement images suggest no uptake, in keeping with thrombus. In comparison to the echo images, the mass bulk appears less than seen yesterday by echo, although caution must be exerted in trans-modality comparison with different spatial and temporal resolution. 2. The central pulmonary artery dimensions appear at upper limits of normal with suspicion of intraluminal segmental thrombotic filling defects as seen by contrast-enhanced CT yesterday. 3. The right ventricle is mild to moderately dilated with mild to moderate global systolic dysfunction but intact interventricular septum, presenting a normal curvature. Severely-dilated right atrium with intact interatrial septum and probable mild central tricuspid regurgitation. 4. Severely-dilated left atrium with normal mitral valve function. The left ventricular volumes, systolic function and mass appear normal with no regional wall motion abnormality, thrombus or pre-contrast signal abnormality was seen. There was no evidence of abnormal late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE). CLINICAL CORRELATION: The right ventricular tissue characterization suggests thrombi with probable decrease in bulk size on intravenous heparin.  IMPRESSION: Right ventricular intracavitary lesion correlating with echocardiography, mid cavity near applicable muscles and showing some mobility on perfusion imaging, not well characterized given gating artifact but presumably reflecting embolic material given the evidence of pulmonary embolism on the recent CT scan in the possible slight decrease in size during treatment of this lesion on the current study compared to the prior CT. No clear or convincing regional wall motion abnormalities involving the left ventricle, although gating artifact precludes confident analysis Right ventricular systolic function appears mildly decreased. Left ventricular systolic function grossly normal No definite evidence of delayed enhancement imaging left ventricular musculature to suggest myocardial scar or inflammation This exam was performed and interpreted in conjunction with Dr. Francois Marcotte from the Department of Cardiovascular Diseases.

COMPARISON: CTA chest 08/25/2015; transesophageal echocardiogram 01/22/2016 IMPRESSION: 1. 2.0 x 0.6 cm interatrial mass with apparent perfusion and delayed enhancement which would suggest cardiac myxoma rather than a thrombus (small size of mass limits sensitivity). 2. Mass has similar appearance and size when compared to CTA Chest of August 25, 2015. 3. Given the small size of mass, CT (or echocardiogram) would be preferred modality for follow-up. 4. Patent foramen ovale. FINDINGS: 2.0 x 0.6 cm mass beginning at the patent foramen ovale and extending caudally to the end of the interatrial septum. Perfusion appears to be present. Delayed enhancement appears to be present which is suggestive of a cardiac myxoma rather than a thrombus (small size of mass limits sensitivity for delayed enhancement and perfusion). In retrospect, this mass was present on prior CT chest for pulmonary embolism dated 08/25/2015. Accounting for differences in technique, it does not appear changed in size between CT 08/25/2015, or transesophageal echocardiogram 01/22/2016. Given the masses small size, it would be best followed with serial CTs or echocardiograms. Electronically signed by: P. A.

COMPARISON: None INDICATION: Chest pain FINDINGS: Heterogeneous uptake in all lobes on perfusion scan with preservation of the margins of all segments (rim sign). Uptake is globally better on perfusion than ventilation. No mismatch. On ventilation imaging, there are multiple central foci of increased radiotracer consistent with turbulent bronchial air flow secondary to patients known COPD history. IMPRESSION: Low probability pulmonary embolism based on todays exam. Multiple areas of hypoperfusion correspond with areas of hypoventilation and are likely secondary to patients known COPD history, however the presence of chronic PE cannot be assessed without prior baseline CT PE or VQ scan. In the absence of prior imaging, CT PE is better modality to evaluate for presence of chronic PE.","Pulmonary Embolism"

Injection: PET/CT TORSO 07/08/2010 IMPRESSION: #1. There is one small 6 mm right supraclavicular lymph node which shows new mild hypermetabolism. This node appears slightly larger than on the previous exam. This could be due to reactive change or early metastasis. Consider ultrasound guided percutaneous needle biopsy of this node. #2. Thickening of the esophagus above and below the distal esophageal carcinoma site, with moderate hypermetabolism consistent with radiation therapy. Uptake at the site of the carcinoma itself has decreased as discussed below. #3. Otherwise negative for interval development of hypermetabolic metastasis. RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 18.0 mCi F-18 FDG i.v. CLINICAL INFORMATION: 72-year-old man with esophageal carcinoma, recently completed combined modality therapy. TECHNIQUE: Positron emission tomography of the TORSO from skull base to upper thighs was performed in this fasting, NONDIABETIC patient with a dedicated ring detector PET/CT scanner 60 minutes after radiopharmaceutical injection. Noncontrast CT was performed for attenuation correction and lesion localization. Automated, variable CT mA dose adjustment used. Glucometer blood glucose was 114 mg/dL prior to tracer injection. FINDINGS: Correlation is made with previous PET CT scan 04/15/2010. The maximum SUV at the site of esophageal carcinoma on the previous exam has decreased from 7.6 previously, to maximum SUV 5.4 today. The uptake is less focal today as well, and extends over a greater length of the esophagus, with at least some of this uptake attribute able to the effect of radiation. There is one small 6 mm right supraclavicular lymph node which shows mild hypermetabolism. This node appears slightly larger than on the previous exam. The mid to distal esophagus is thickwalled and shows circumferential hypermetabolism, probably corresponding to the region of irradiation. Mild uptake along tract of the jejunostomy tube. No abnormal uptake in the previously identified subcarinal lymph node. Distribution of radiopharmaceutical is otherwise within expected physiologic variation. Noncontrast CT localizer images are reviewed. The esophageal wall cephalad to the previously identified distal esophageal mass is more thickened today, probably a result of radiation. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly decreased on the left compared to 06/04/2010 CT, and slightly increased on the right. Punctate coronary calcifications. Azygos lobe and fissure. Right chest wall subcutaneous catheter with tip in SVC. Strandy atelectasis in the right lower lobe. The amount of parenchymal opacity in the subpleural left lingula has decreased slightly compared to the previous CT. This is probably an infarct related to prior pulmonary embolism seen on the CT 06/04/2010. Previously enlarged lymph nodes in the right paraesophageal area are less impressive today and are not hypermetabolic. No new lymphadenopathy. IVC filter. Bilateral parapelvic renal cysts. Pockets of gas in the right abdominal wall and left abdominal wall subcutaneous fat may be related to subcutaneous injections. Prostate moderately enlarged. Trace pelvic fluid. No suspicious bone lesions or other significant change. This report has been electronically signed by Roarke, Michael MD on Jul 8 2010 1:50PM. Electronically signed by: M. C.

FINDINGS: Minimally displaced right C4 transverse process fracture extending into the right transverse foramen. CTA or MRA could provide further information regarding the integrity of the right vertebral artery. Additionally, there is new widening of the C4-C5 interspace including new mild retrolisthesis. This occurs in conjunction with newly fractured anterior and posterior osteophytes at C4-C5 suggesting potential injury to the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments. Moreover, there is new subluxation of the right C4-C5 and, to a lesser extent, the right C5-C6 facet joints suggesting potential injury to the posterior ligament complex. MRI may provide additional information regarding potential spinal cord ligament injury if clinically warranted. No additional acute cervical spine fractures are identified. The craniocervical junction is intact. Substantial prevertebral soft tissue and muscular edema is noted. There is prominent high density material circumferentially involving the epidural space from the skull base through at least the C4 level. This is consistent with a large epidural hematoma. A lesser degree of more inferiorly extending epidural hematoma may be present but is likely obscured by image noise. Epidural hematoma substantially narrows the thecal sac. The impact of the epidural hematoma on the spinal cord could be more accurately assessed with cervical spine MRI. Additionally, there is a small amount of intrathecal blood near the craniocervical junction on the left that is continuous with known intracranial posttraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
