Mild compression deformities of the superior endplates of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies, without fracture line evident. These are difficult to age at CT but may be chronic. No other fracture. Several millimeters of anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and mild anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and of C5 on C6. Advanced multilevel facet arthrosis. A central disc protrusion or extrusion at C3-4 contributes along with the spondylolisthesis and posterior ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding to spinal canal stenosis and probably moderate compression of the spinal cord. Ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding is notable also at a few other levels, particularly at C2-3. Neural foraminal stenosis is advanced at left C3-4 and moderate at right C3-4. On initial scanning, at the level of C3 to the inferior endplate of C4, there was apparent hyperdensity within the spinal canal, circumferentially about the cord (for example series 8, image 47). The patient was brought back for additional scanning given the indeterminate nature of the hyperdensity after discussion with Andrea Hlady, MD, PhD (pager #11001). On repeat imaging (series 15 and 19), the hyperdensity within the spinal canal has an appearance more compatible with ligamentous redundancy rather than epidural hematoma.

 FINDINGS: Continued progression of previously described enhancing soft tissue abnormality involving 
 
 the body and splenium of the corpus callosum. This presumed tumor progression now extends greater 
 
 posteriorly into the splenium of the corpus callosum and into the white matter adjacent to the 
 
 atrium of both lateral ventricles. There is greater anterior tumor spread into the body of the 
 
 corpus callosum and along the intraventricular septum., as well as, into the posterior margins of 
 
 both thalamic nuclei. There is superior spread into the cingulate gyrus on the right, deep right 
 
 parietal and posterior frontal white matter and into the deep left parietal white matter. Tumor is 
 
 seen extending along the posterior and medial margins of the cystic defect within the deep right 
 
 parietal lobe. There is subependymoma spread of tumor along the posterior margins of both lateral 
 
 ventricles and into the fornices as previously described. Diffusion restriction in these areas 
 
 supports progression of high-grade glioma. There is mild increase in local mass effect associated 
 
 with this tumor progression.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 TUMOR: 
 
 Location: Left frontal. 
 
 
 
 
 
 FLAIR: Stable to slightly improved extent of confluent nonenhancing, predominantly non-masslike 
 
 FLAIR abnormality in the left frontal lobe surrounding the left frontal resection cavity and 
 
 extending along the left lateral ventricle. Persistent non-masslike, nonenhancing FLAIR abnormality 
 
 extending transcallosally along the genu of the corpus callosum into the right pericallosal white 
 
 matter. Increased intralesional T2 FLAIR hyperintensity about the superiormost centrally necrotic 
 
 lesions (se9/im27), possibly reflecting changes and fluid distribution or proteinaceous debris. No 
 
 new sites of FLAIR abnormality. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Enhancement: Continued enlargement of previously described masslike enhancement; for example the 
 
 centrally necrotic enhancing mass/moiety along the superior and medial resection cavity margin 
 
 measures 16 x 14 x 16 mm (AP x LR x SI) today compared with 13 x 14 x 14 mm previously (se16/im105, 
 
 se17/im154). Similar degree of interval enlargement of peripherally enhancing centrally necrotic 
 
 lesion along the medial and inferior resection cavity margin (se16/im84, se17/im154) and more 
 
 conglomerate multinodular mass with peripheral enhancement and central necrosis extending into the 
 
 body of the left lateral ventricle (se1im109, se17/im126). Slightly increased conspicuity of smaller 
 
 foci of enhancement along the ventral and lateral resection cavity margins (se16/im81). Stable 2 to 
 
 3 mm focus of enhancement in the left insula (se16/im78). No new discrete areas of abnormal 
 
 intracranial enhancement. 
 
  
 
 Diffusion: Areas of abnormally decreased diffusion are seen, compatible with areas of hypercellular 
 
 tumor. Increased prominence of restricted diffusion is noted in several of the discrete centrally 
 
 necrotic lesions, compatible with increased hypercellularity.

 with clear elevated relative cerebral blood volume (series 18, images 53 through 55). The

 COMPARISON: Outside functional brain MRI 3/16/2022 and outside noncontrast stereotactic head CT
 
 dated 4/11/2022 are the only images available for review at the time of interpretation.
 
 
 
 
 
 FINDINGS: Since 3/16/2022 MR, significant interval progression of expansile, T2 hyperintense signal
 
 throughout the left temporal lobe, supraorbital left frontal lobe, basal ganglia, left thalamus, and
 
 tracking across midline at the genu of the corpus callosum and fornix into the right parahippocampal
 
 gyrus, right medial temporal lobe, and right thalamus. T2 signal further tracks down the left
 
 cerebral peduncle into the midbrain and pons. Overall, these findings are consistent with
 
 infiltrating glial tumor. These components of the tumor do not demonstrate restricted diffusion or
 
 decreased ADC values. 
 
 
 
 
 
 However, there is a new focus of restricted diffusion within the lateral left pons that demonstrates
 
 mild associated mass effect and appears contiguous with the tract of abnormal T2 signal tracking
 
 along the left midbrain and pons. There is no associated enhancement. While an acute infarct could
 
 appear similar, this appearance is favored to represent a highly cellular component of the glial
 
 tumor.
 
 
 
 
 
 Overall, supratentorial mass effect from the infiltrative neoplastic process results in 8 mm of
 
 midline shift at the level of the foramen of Monro which has progressed 4/11/2022 when there was 5
 
 mm of midline shift. Midline shift results in near complete effacement of the third ventricle with
 
 interval increase in the caliber of the lateral ventricles, greater on the right, consistent with
 
 developing obstructive hydrocephalus. Furthermore, further effacement of the basilar cisterns, more
 
 notably in the region of the interpeduncular fossa with distortion of the lateral midbrain
 
 bilaterally represents some component of developing uncal herniation. Crowding of the cerebellar
 
 tonsils in the region of the foramen magnum is also increased consistent with increasing
 
 intracranial pressure.
 
 
 
 
 
 New somewhat nodular leptomeningeal enhancement tracking along the left sylvian fissure and the left
 
 middle cerebral artery (series 900/image 114) and along the supraorbital left frontal marginal gyrus
 
 leptomeninges (series 900/ image 111) is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma.
 
 
 
 
 
 Interval postprocedural changes of left temporal craniotomy and temporal lobe biopsy. New linear
 
 enhancement within the anterior left temporal lobe parenchyma likely represents postbiopsy change as
 
 it is confined to the temporal lobe adjacent to the craniotomy site, although tumor transformation
 
 not entirely excluded. Enhancement of the extracranial soft tissues overlying the left temporal
 
 craniotomy is likely reactive.
 
 
 
 
 
 No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval progression of diffuse infiltrating glioma brain as detailed. 
 
 2. Interval increase in the associated mass effect resulting in progressive rightward midline shift
 
 (up to 8 mm) with resultant effacement of 3rd ventricle causing mild obstructive hydrocephalus.
 
 Further effacement of the basilar cisterns and crowding of the foramen magnum consistent with
 
 increasing intracranial pressures. 
 
 3. New leptomeningeal enhancement is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma. 
 
 4. New, expansile restricted diffusion in the lateral left pons is favored for represent a component
 
 of hypercellular glial tumor, although an acute infarct could appear similar and is not entirely
 
 excluded. 
 
 5. Interval biopsy of the anterior left frontal lobe with intraparenchymal enhancement favored to
 
 represent post-biopsy change as it is confined to the region of the temporal lobe subjacent to the
 
 craniotomy. However, glial tumor transformation is not excluded. Attention at follow up is
 
 recommended.

 measuring approximately 14.0 x 11.11 x 6.2 cm (series 304, image 23 and series
 
 604, image 76), likely unchanged since the recent comparison ultrasound
 
 accounting for differences in imaging modality. No evidence of contrast
 
 extravasation or change in density configuration on delayed imaging to suggest
 
 active bleeding. Scattered areas of decreased perfusion in the inferior right
 
 hepatic lobe. Marked narrowing of the inferior vena cava at the anastomosis (for
 
 example series 4, image 51). 
 
 
 
 
 
 Enlarging splenomegaly since the prior CT measuring 19.0 cm, previously 15.6 cm.
 
 Multiple upper abdominal varices. Increasing mesenteric edema and scattered
 
 perienteric fluid, favored secondary to a combination of postoperative
 
 inflammation and portal enteropathy. Small amount of low density dependent free
 
 pelvic fluid. Multiple mildly prominent upper abdominal retroperitoneal lymph
 
 nodes are favored reactive. Mild diffuse body wall edema. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Redemonstrated postoperative changes of total proctocolectomy with ileoanal
 
 pouch anastomosis. Similar gaseous distention of the distal ileum about the

 Left Anterior Descending: Densely calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the proximal and mid LAD
 
 obscures visualization of the lumen in several locations and may result in severe stenosis. Distal
 
 LAD appears patent, however is not well evaluated due to motion. Patent 1st and 2nd diagonal
 
 branches. Small amount of calcified plaque in the 1st diagonal branch results in likely mild
 
 stenosis, however portions of the diagonal branches are nondiagnostic due to motion.
 
 Left Circumflex: Scattered calcified atherosclerotic plaque resulting in mild-moderate stenosis
 
 proximally. Distal left circumflex not well evaluated due to small size. Dense focus of calcium in
 
 the 1st obtuse marginal branch obscures visualization of the lumen and may result in severe
 
 stenosis, however suboptimal evaluation due to motion. 
 
 Ramus intermedius: Tiny patent ramus intermedius branch
 
 Right Coronary Artery: Mild ostial stenosis due to calcified plaque. Scattered additional calcified
 
 plaque proximally resulting in likely mild stenosis. Calcified plaque in the distal right coronary
 
 artery with probable mild/moderate stenosis, however nondiagnostic due to blooming artifact from
 
 calcium and motion. Focal calcified plaque at the origin of the posterolateral branch with possible
 
 moderate stenosis. Additional scattered plaque or distally in the posterolateral branch which is
 
 patent. Calcified plaque at the origin of the PDA, nondiagnostic for degree of stenosis due to
 
 motion. The PDA appears patent.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 1 mm axial images were reconstructed through the chest
 
 following a single breath-hold helical acquisition during the administration of
 
 intravenous contrast material during the pulmonary arterial phase. Images were
 
 reformatted in the axial plane using maximum intensity projections to increase
 
 the conspicuity of the pulmonary circulation. 3D imaging tools were used as
 
 needed to clarify the relevant anatomy. Iodinated contrast administered
 
 intravenously.

Mild compression deformities of the superior endplates of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies, without fracture line evident. These are difficult to age at CT but may be chronic. No other fracture. Several millimeters of anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and mild anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and of C5 on C6. Advanced multilevel facet arthrosis. A central disc protrusion or extrusion at C3-4 contributes along with the spondylolisthesis and posterior ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding to spinal canal stenosis and probably moderate compression of the spinal cord. Ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding is notable also at a few other levels, particularly at C2-3. Neural foraminal stenosis is advanced at left C3-4 and moderate at right C3-4. On initial scanning, at the level of C3 to the inferior endplate of C4, there was apparent hyperdensity within the spinal canal, circumferentially about the cord (for example series 8, image 47). The patient was brought back for additional scanning given the indeterminate nature of the hyperdensity after discussion with Andrea Hlady, MD, PhD (pager #11001). On repeat imaging (series 15 and 19), the hyperdensity within the spinal canal has an appearance more compatible with ligamentous redundancy rather than epidural hematoma. Calcified atheromatous plaque both carotid bifurcations. The partially visualized lung apices are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1.

 FINDINGS: Continued progression of previously described enhancing soft tissue abnormality involving 
 
 the body and splenium of the corpus callosum. This presumed tumor progression now extends greater 
 
 posteriorly into the splenium of the corpus callosum and into the white matter adjacent to the 
 
 atrium of both lateral ventricles. There is greater anterior tumor spread into the body of the 
 
 corpus callosum and along the intraventricular septum., as well as, into the posterior margins of 
 
 both thalamic nuclei. There is superior spread into the cingulate gyrus on the right, deep right 
 
 parietal and posterior frontal white matter and into the deep left parietal white matter. Tumor is 
 
 seen extending along the posterior and medial margins of the cystic defect within the deep right 
 
 parietal lobe. There is subependymoma spread of tumor along the posterior margins of both lateral 
 
 ventricles and into the fornices as previously described. Diffusion restriction in these areas 
 
 supports progression of high-grade glioma. There is mild increase in local mass effect associated 
 
 with this tumor progression.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 TUMOR: 
 
 Location: Left frontal. 
 
 
 
 
 
 FLAIR: Stable to slightly improved extent of confluent nonenhancing, predominantly non-masslike 
 
 FLAIR abnormality in the left frontal lobe surrounding the left frontal resection cavity and 
 
 extending along the left lateral ventricle. Persistent non-masslike, nonenhancing FLAIR abnormality 
 
 extending transcallosally along the genu of the corpus callosum into the right pericallosal white 
 
 matter. Increased intralesional T2 FLAIR hyperintensity about the superiormost centrally necrotic 
 
 lesions (se9/im27), possibly reflecting changes and fluid distribution or proteinaceous debris. No 
 
 new sites of FLAIR abnormality. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Enhancement: Continued enlargement of previously described masslike enhancement; for example the 
 
 centrally necrotic enhancing mass/moiety along the superior and medial resection cavity margin 
 
 measures 16 x 14 x 16 mm (AP x LR x SI) today compared with 13 x 14 x 14 mm previously (se16/im105, 
 
 se17/im154). Similar degree of interval enlargement of peripherally enhancing centrally necrotic 
 
 lesion along the medial and inferior resection cavity margin (se16/im84, se17/im154) and more 
 
 conglomerate multinodular mass with peripheral enhancement and central necrosis extending into the 
 
 body of the left lateral ventricle (se1im109, se17/im126). Slightly increased conspicuity of smaller 
 
 foci of enhancement along the ventral and lateral resection cavity margins (se16/im81). Stable 2 to 
 
 3 mm focus of enhancement in the left insula (se16/im78). No new discrete areas of abnormal 
 
 intracranial enhancement. 
 
  
 
 Diffusion: Areas of abnormally decreased diffusion are seen, compatible with areas of hypercellular 
 
 tumor. Increased prominence of restricted diffusion is noted in several of the discrete centrally 
 
 necrotic lesions, compatible with increased hypercellularity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Perfusion: Similar degree of regional hyperperfusion within the largest cluster of masslike 
 
 enhancement (se1369/im111). Other areas of nodular masslike enhancement demonstrate more equivocal

 with clear elevated relative cerebral blood volume (series 18, images 53 through 55). The
 
 multiloculated cystic/necrotic deeper component appears slightly smaller.

 COMPARISON: Outside functional brain MRI 3/16/2022 and outside noncontrast stereotactic head CT
 
 dated 4/11/2022 are the only images available for review at the time of interpretation.
 
 
 
 
 
 FINDINGS: Since 3/16/2022 MR, significant interval progression of expansile, T2 hyperintense signal
 
 throughout the left temporal lobe, supraorbital left frontal lobe, basal ganglia, left thalamus, and
 
 tracking across midline at the genu of the corpus callosum and fornix into the right parahippocampal
 
 gyrus, right medial temporal lobe, and right thalamus. T2 signal further tracks down the left
 
 cerebral peduncle into the midbrain and pons. Overall, these findings are consistent with
 
 infiltrating glial tumor. These components of the tumor do not demonstrate restricted diffusion or
 
 decreased ADC values. 
 
 
 
 
 
 However, there is a new focus of restricted diffusion within the lateral left pons that demonstrates
 
 mild associated mass effect and appears contiguous with the tract of abnormal T2 signal tracking
 
 along the left midbrain and pons. There is no associated enhancement. While an acute infarct could
 
 appear similar, this appearance is favored to represent a highly cellular component of the glial
 
 tumor.
 
 
 
 
 
 Overall, supratentorial mass effect from the infiltrative neoplastic process results in 8 mm of
 
 midline shift at the level of the foramen of Monro which has progressed 4/11/2022 when there was 5
 
 mm of midline shift. Midline shift results in near complete effacement of the third ventricle with
 
 interval increase in the caliber of the lateral ventricles, greater on the right, consistent with
 
 developing obstructive hydrocephalus. Furthermore, further effacement of the basilar cisterns, more
 
 notably in the region of the interpeduncular fossa with distortion of the lateral midbrain
 
 bilaterally represents some component of developing uncal herniation. Crowding of the cerebellar
 
 tonsils in the region of the foramen magnum is also increased consistent with increasing
 
 intracranial pressure.
 
 
 
 
 
 New somewhat nodular leptomeningeal enhancement tracking along the left sylvian fissure and the left
 
 middle cerebral artery (series 900/image 114) and along the supraorbital left frontal marginal gyrus
 
 leptomeninges (series 900/ image 111) is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma.
 
 
 
 
 
 Interval postprocedural changes of left temporal craniotomy and temporal lobe biopsy. New linear
 
 enhancement within the anterior left temporal lobe parenchyma likely represents postbiopsy change as
 
 it is confined to the temporal lobe adjacent to the craniotomy site, although tumor transformation
 
 not entirely excluded. Enhancement of the extracranial soft tissues overlying the left temporal
 
 craniotomy is likely reactive.
 
 
 
 
 
 No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval progression of diffuse infiltrating glioma brain as detailed. 
 
 2. Interval increase in the associated mass effect resulting in progressive rightward midline shift
 
 (up to 8 mm) with resultant effacement of 3rd ventricle causing mild obstructive hydrocephalus.
 
 Further effacement of the basilar cisterns and crowding of the foramen magnum consistent with
 
 increasing intracranial pressures. 
 
 3. New leptomeningeal enhancement is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma. 
 
 4. New, expansile restricted diffusion in the lateral left pons is favored for represent a component
 
 of hypercellular glial tumor, although an acute infarct could appear similar and is not entirely
 
 excluded. 
 
 5. Interval biopsy of the anterior left frontal lobe with intraparenchymal enhancement favored to
 
 represent post-biopsy change as it is confined to the region of the temporal lobe subjacent to the
 
 craniotomy. However, glial tumor transformation is not excluded. Attention at follow up is
 
 recommended.

 measuring approximately 14.0 x 11.11 x 6.2 cm (series 304, image 23 and series
 
 604, image 76), likely unchanged since the recent comparison ultrasound
 
 accounting for differences in imaging modality. No evidence of contrast
 
 extravasation or change in density configuration on delayed imaging to suggest
 
 active bleeding. Scattered areas of decreased perfusion in the inferior right
 
 hepatic lobe. Marked narrowing of the inferior vena cava at the anastomosis (for

 Enlarging splenomegaly since the prior CT measuring 19.0 cm, previously 15.6 cm.
 
 Multiple upper abdominal varices. Increasing mesenteric edema and scattered
 
 perienteric fluid, favored secondary to a combination of postoperative
 
 inflammation and portal enteropathy. Small amount of low density dependent free
 
 pelvic fluid. Multiple mildly prominent upper abdominal retroperitoneal lymph
 
 nodes are favored reactive. Mild diffuse body wall edema.

 LAD appears patent, however is not well evaluated due to motion. Patent 1st and 2nd diagonal
 
 branches. Small amount of calcified plaque in the 1st diagonal branch results in likely mild
 
 stenosis, however portions of the diagonal branches are nondiagnostic due to motion.
 
 Left Circumflex: Scattered calcified atherosclerotic plaque resulting in mild-moderate stenosis
 
 proximally. Distal left circumflex not well evaluated due to small size. Dense focus of calcium in
 
 the 1st obtuse marginal branch obscures visualization of the lumen and may result in severe
 
 stenosis, however suboptimal evaluation due to motion. 
 
 Ramus intermedius: Tiny patent ramus intermedius branch
 
 Right Coronary Artery: Mild ostial stenosis due to calcified plaque. Scattered additional calcified
 
 plaque proximally resulting in likely mild stenosis. Calcified plaque in the distal right coronary
 
 artery with probable mild/moderate stenosis, however nondiagnostic due to blooming artifact from
 
 calcium and motion. Focal calcified plaque at the origin of the posterolateral branch with possible
 
 moderate stenosis. Additional scattered plaque or distally in the posterolateral branch which is

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 1 mm axial images were reconstructed through the chest
 
 following a single breath-hold helical acquisition during the administration of
 
 intravenous contrast material during the pulmonary arterial phase. Images were
 
 reformatted in the axial plane using maximum intensity projections to increase
 
 the conspicuity of the pulmonary circulation. 3D imaging tools were used as
 
 needed to clarify the relevant anatomy. Iodinated contrast administered
 
 intravenously.

8,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,"EXAM: CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST COMPARISON: No comparison available. FINDINGS: Exam is limited by patient positioning in extreme neck flexion. Mild compression deformities of the superior endplates of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies, without fracture line evident. These are difficult to age at CT but may be chronic. No other fracture. Several millimeters of anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and mild anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and of C5 on C6. Advanced multilevel facet arthrosis. A central disc protrusion or extrusion at C3-4 contributes along with the spondylolisthesis and posterior ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding to spinal canal stenosis and probably moderate compression of the spinal cord. Ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding is notable also at a few other levels, particularly at C2-3. Neural foraminal stenosis is advanced at left C3-4 and moderate at right C3-4. On initial scanning, at the level of C3 to the inferior endplate of C4, there was apparent hyperdensity within the spinal canal, circumferentially about the cord (for example series 8, image 47). The patient was brought back for additional scanning given the indeterminate nature of the hyperdensity after discussion with Andrea Hlady, MD, PhD (pager #11001). On repeat imaging (series 15 and 19), the hyperdensity within the spinal canal has an appearance more compatible with ligamentous redundancy rather than epidural hematoma. Calcified atheromatous plaque both carotid bifurcations. The partially visualized lung apices are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute fracture or traumatic malalignment in the cervical spine. Multi-level mild to moderate vertebral subluxations are favored to be chronic. 2. Mild superior endplate compression fractures of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies. Although their age is not entirely certain, they may be chronic. 3.

 FINDINGS: Continued progression of previously described enhancing soft tissue abnormality involving 
 
 the body and splenium of the corpus callosum. This presumed tumor progression now extends greater 
 
 posteriorly into the splenium of the corpus callosum and into the white matter adjacent to the 
 
 atrium of both lateral ventricles. There is greater anterior tumor spread into the body of the 
 
 corpus callosum and along the intraventricular septum., as well as, into the posterior margins of 
 
 both thalamic nuclei. There is superior spread into the cingulate gyrus on the right, deep right 
 
 parietal and posterior frontal white matter and into the deep left parietal white matter. Tumor is 
 
 seen extending along the posterior and medial margins of the cystic defect within the deep right 
 
 parietal lobe. There is subependymoma spread of tumor along the posterior margins of both lateral 
 
 ventricles and into the fornices as previously described. Diffusion restriction in these areas 
 
 supports progression of high-grade glioma. There is mild increase in local mass effect associated 
 
 with this tumor progression.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 TUMOR: 
 
 Location: Left frontal. 
 
 
 
 
 
 FLAIR: Stable to slightly improved extent of confluent nonenhancing, predominantly non-masslike 
 
 FLAIR abnormality in the left frontal lobe surrounding the left frontal resection cavity and 
 
 extending along the left lateral ventricle. Persistent non-masslike, nonenhancing FLAIR abnormality 
 
 extending transcallosally along the genu of the corpus callosum into the right pericallosal white 
 
 matter. Increased intralesional T2 FLAIR hyperintensity about the superiormost centrally necrotic 
 
 lesions (se9/im27), possibly reflecting changes and fluid distribution or proteinaceous debris. No 
 
 new sites of FLAIR abnormality. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Enhancement: Continued enlargement of previously described masslike enhancement; for example the 
 
 centrally necrotic enhancing mass/moiety along the superior and medial resection cavity margin 
 
 measures 16 x 14 x 16 mm (AP x LR x SI) today compared with 13 x 14 x 14 mm previously (se16/im105, 
 
 se17/im154). Similar degree of interval enlargement of peripherally enhancing centrally necrotic 
 
 lesion along the medial and inferior resection cavity margin (se16/im84, se17/im154) and more 
 
 conglomerate multinodular mass with peripheral enhancement and central necrosis extending into the 
 
 body of the left lateral ventricle (se1im109, se17/im126). Slightly increased conspicuity of smaller 
 
 foci of enhancement along the ventral and lateral resection cavity margins (se16/im81). Stable 2 to 
 
 3 mm focus of enhancement in the left insula (se16/im78). No new discrete areas of abnormal 
 
 intracranial enhancement. 
 
  
 
 Diffusion: Areas of abnormally decreased diffusion are seen, compatible with areas of hypercellular 
 
 tumor. Increased prominence of restricted diffusion is noted in several of the discrete centrally 
 
 necrotic lesions, compatible with increased hypercellularity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Perfusion: Similar degree of regional hyperperfusion within the largest cluster of masslike 
 
 enhancement (se1369/im111). Other areas of nodular masslike enhancement demonstrate more equivocal

 with clear elevated relative cerebral blood volume (series 18, images 53 through 55). The

 COMPARISON: Outside functional brain MRI 3/16/2022 and outside noncontrast stereotactic head CT
 
 dated 4/11/2022 are the only images available for review at the time of interpretation.
 
 
 
 
 
 FINDINGS: Since 3/16/2022 MR, significant interval progression of expansile, T2 hyperintense signal
 
 throughout the left temporal lobe, supraorbital left frontal lobe, basal ganglia, left thalamus, and
 
 tracking across midline at the genu of the corpus callosum and fornix into the right parahippocampal
 
 gyrus, right medial temporal lobe, and right thalamus. T2 signal further tracks down the left
 
 cerebral peduncle into the midbrain and pons. Overall, these findings are consistent with
 
 infiltrating glial tumor. These components of the tumor do not demonstrate restricted diffusion or
 
 decreased ADC values. 
 
 
 
 
 
 However, there is a new focus of restricted diffusion within the lateral left pons that demonstrates
 
 mild associated mass effect and appears contiguous with the tract of abnormal T2 signal tracking
 
 along the left midbrain and pons. There is no associated enhancement. While an acute infarct could
 
 appear similar, this appearance is favored to represent a highly cellular component of the glial
 
 tumor.
 
 
 
 
 
 Overall, supratentorial mass effect from the infiltrative neoplastic process results in 8 mm of
 
 midline shift at the level of the foramen of Monro which has progressed 4/11/2022 when there was 5
 
 mm of midline shift. Midline shift results in near complete effacement of the third ventricle with
 
 interval increase in the caliber of the lateral ventricles, greater on the right, consistent with
 
 developing obstructive hydrocephalus. Furthermore, further effacement of the basilar cisterns, more
 
 notably in the region of the interpeduncular fossa with distortion of the lateral midbrain
 
 bilaterally represents some component of developing uncal herniation. Crowding of the cerebellar
 
 tonsils in the region of the foramen magnum is also increased consistent with increasing
 
 intracranial pressure.
 
 
 
 
 
 New somewhat nodular leptomeningeal enhancement tracking along the left sylvian fissure and the left
 
 middle cerebral artery (series 900/image 114) and along the supraorbital left frontal marginal gyrus
 
 leptomeninges (series 900/ image 111) is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma.
 
 
 
 
 
 Interval postprocedural changes of left temporal craniotomy and temporal lobe biopsy. New linear
 
 enhancement within the anterior left temporal lobe parenchyma likely represents postbiopsy change as
 
 it is confined to the temporal lobe adjacent to the craniotomy site, although tumor transformation
 
 not entirely excluded. Enhancement of the extracranial soft tissues overlying the left temporal
 
 craniotomy is likely reactive.
 
 
 
 
 
 No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval progression of diffuse infiltrating glioma brain as detailed. 
 
 2. Interval increase in the associated mass effect resulting in progressive rightward midline shift
 
 (up to 8 mm) with resultant effacement of 3rd ventricle causing mild obstructive hydrocephalus.
 
 Further effacement of the basilar cisterns and crowding of the foramen magnum consistent with
 
 increasing intracranial pressures. 
 
 3. New leptomeningeal enhancement is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma. 
 
 4. New, expansile restricted diffusion in the lateral left pons is favored for represent a component
 
 of hypercellular glial tumor, although an acute infarct could appear similar and is not entirely
 
 excluded. 
 
 5. Interval biopsy of the anterior left frontal lobe with intraparenchymal enhancement favored to
 
 represent post-biopsy change as it is confined to the region of the temporal lobe subjacent to the
 
 craniotomy. However, glial tumor transformation is not excluded. Attention at follow up is
 
 recommended.

 right middle cerebellar peduncle, without significant change. The mass again measures approximately 
 
 3.6 cm transverse by 2.8 cm AP on series 6 image 12. Again seen is the biopsy tract in the right 
 
 cerebellar hemisphere, and along the right lateral aspect of the mass lesion, with expected 
 
 postoperative change. The mass again causes mild deformity of the ventral aspect of the fourth 
 
 ventricle. There is no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus. However, there is mild mass effect at 
 
 the level of the foramen magnum, with inferior cerebellar tonsillar descent, as seen on series 4

 a right frontal oligodendroglioma. Chronic blood products are present within the surgical resection
 
 cavity.
 
 3. Nonenhancing T2 signal changes: Nonenhancing T2 hyperintensity within the posterior right
 
 frontal lobe and parietal lobe are grossly unchanged from prior study. There may be minimal
 
 increased nonenhancing signal within the anterior right frontal lobe. Nonenhancing T2 hyperintense,
 
 T2/FLAIR hypointense multiloculated cystic component located centrally within this lesion has
 
 increased in size from prior studies and demonstrates progressive growth from November 2021 through
 
 current study. Largest cystic component measures 2.7 x 1.9 cm compared to 2 x 1.3 cm on prior study.
 
 4. Enhancement: Confluent enhancing tissue is present immediately subjacent to the craniotomy.
 
 Additional more wispy and heterogeneous soft tissue enhancement is present within the peripheral
 
 anterior portions of the lesion. These findings are unchanged from prior study.

 measuring approximately 14.0 x 11.11 x 6.2 cm (series 304, image 23 and series
 
 604, image 76), likely unchanged since the recent comparison ultrasound
 
 accounting for differences in imaging modality. No evidence of contrast
 
 extravasation or change in density configuration on delayed imaging to suggest
 
 active bleeding. Scattered areas of decreased perfusion in the inferior right
 
 hepatic lobe. Marked narrowing of the inferior vena cava at the anastomosis (for

 Enlarging splenomegaly since the prior CT measuring 19.0 cm, previously 15.6 cm.
 
 Multiple upper abdominal varices. Increasing mesenteric edema and scattered
 
 perienteric fluid, favored secondary to a combination of postoperative
 
 inflammation and portal enteropathy. Small amount of low density dependent free
 
 pelvic fluid. Multiple mildly prominent upper abdominal retroperitoneal lymph
 
 nodes are favored reactive. Mild diffuse body wall edema. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Redemonstrated postoperative changes of total proctocolectomy with ileoanal

 LAD appears patent, however is not well evaluated due to motion. Patent 1st and 2nd diagonal
 
 branches. Small amount of calcified plaque in the 1st diagonal branch results in likely mild
 
 stenosis, however portions of the diagonal branches are nondiagnostic due to motion.
 
 Left Circumflex: Scattered calcified atherosclerotic plaque resulting in mild-moderate stenosis
 
 proximally. Distal left circumflex not well evaluated due to small size. Dense focus of calcium in
 
 the 1st obtuse marginal branch obscures visualization of the lumen and may result in severe
 
 stenosis, however suboptimal evaluation due to motion. 
 
 Ramus intermedius: Tiny patent ramus intermedius branch
 
 Right Coronary Artery: Mild ostial stenosis due to calcified plaque. Scattered additional calcified
 
 plaque proximally resulting in likely mild stenosis. Calcified plaque in the distal right coronary

 ADDITIONAL CLINICAL HISTORY: None
 
 
 
 
 
 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 1 mm axial images were reconstructed through the chest
 
 following a single breath-hold helical acquisition during the administration of
 
 intravenous contrast material during the pulmonary arterial phase. Images were
 
 reformatted in the axial plane using maximum intensity projections to increase
 
 the conspicuity of the pulmonary circulation. 3D imaging tools were used as
 
 needed to clarify the relevant anatomy. Iodinated contrast administered
 
 intravenously.

Ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding is notable also at a few other levels, particularly at C2-3. Neural foraminal stenosis is advanced at left C3-4 and moderate at right C3-4. On initial scanning, at the level of C3 to the inferior endplate of C4, there was apparent hyperdensity within the spinal canal, circumferentially about the cord (for example series 8, image 47). The patient was brought back for additional scanning given the indeterminate nature of the hyperdensity after discussion with Andrea Hlady, MD, PhD (pager #11001). On repeat imaging (series 15 and 19), the hyperdensity within the spinal canal has an appearance more compatible with ligamentous redundancy rather than epidural hematoma. Calcified atheromatous plaque both carotid bifurcations. The partially visualized lung apices are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute fracture or traumatic malalignment in the cervical spine. Multi-level mild to moderate vertebral subluxations are favored to be chronic. 2. Mild superior endplate compression fractures of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies. Although their age is not entirely certain, they may be chronic. 3.

 FINDINGS: Continued progression of previously described enhancing soft tissue abnormality involving 
 
 the body and splenium of the corpus callosum. This presumed tumor progression now extends greater 
 
 posteriorly into the splenium of the corpus callosum and into the white matter adjacent to the 
 
 atrium of both lateral ventricles. There is greater anterior tumor spread into the body of the 
 
 corpus callosum and along the intraventricular septum., as well as, into the posterior margins of 
 
 both thalamic nuclei. There is superior spread into the cingulate gyrus on the right, deep right 
 
 parietal and posterior frontal white matter and into the deep left parietal white matter. Tumor is 
 
 seen extending along the posterior and medial margins of the cystic defect within the deep right 
 
 parietal lobe. There is subependymoma spread of tumor along the posterior margins of both lateral 
 
 ventricles and into the fornices as previously described. Diffusion restriction in these areas 
 
 supports progression of high-grade glioma. There is mild increase in local mass effect associated 
 
 with this tumor progression.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 TUMOR: 
 
 Location: Left frontal. 
 
 
 
 
 
 FLAIR: Stable to slightly improved extent of confluent nonenhancing, predominantly non-masslike 
 
 FLAIR abnormality in the left frontal lobe surrounding the left frontal resection cavity and 
 
 extending along the left lateral ventricle. Persistent non-masslike, nonenhancing FLAIR abnormality 
 
 extending transcallosally along the genu of the corpus callosum into the right pericallosal white 
 
 matter. Increased intralesional T2 FLAIR hyperintensity about the superiormost centrally necrotic 
 
 lesions (se9/im27), possibly reflecting changes and fluid distribution or proteinaceous debris. No 
 
 new sites of FLAIR abnormality. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Enhancement: Continued enlargement of previously described masslike enhancement; for example the 
 
 centrally necrotic enhancing mass/moiety along the superior and medial resection cavity margin 
 
 measures 16 x 14 x 16 mm (AP x LR x SI) today compared with 13 x 14 x 14 mm previously (se16/im105, 
 
 se17/im154). Similar degree of interval enlargement of peripherally enhancing centrally necrotic 
 
 lesion along the medial and inferior resection cavity margin (se16/im84, se17/im154) and more 
 
 conglomerate multinodular mass with peripheral enhancement and central necrosis extending into the 
 
 body of the left lateral ventricle (se1im109, se17/im126). Slightly increased conspicuity of smaller 
 
 foci of enhancement along the ventral and lateral resection cavity margins (se16/im81). Stable 2 to 
 
 3 mm focus of enhancement in the left insula (se16/im78). No new discrete areas of abnormal 
 
 intracranial enhancement. 
 
  
 
 Diffusion: Areas of abnormally decreased diffusion are seen, compatible with areas of hypercellular 
 
 tumor. Increased prominence of restricted diffusion is noted in several of the discrete centrally 
 
 necrotic lesions, compatible with increased hypercellularity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Perfusion: Similar degree of regional hyperperfusion within the largest cluster of masslike 
 
 enhancement (se1369/im111). Other areas of nodular masslike enhancement demonstrate more equivocal 
 
 or no hyperperfusion.

 artifact related to internal hemorrhage which somewhat limits the accuracy of perfusion analysis,
 
 but there is likely elevated relative cerebral blood volume within this lesion. Of note, along the
 
 precentral gyrus at the posterior aspect of the mass, there is a new nodular enhancing component
 
 with clear elevated relative cerebral blood volume (series 18, images 53 through 55). The
 
 multiloculated cystic/necrotic deeper component appears slightly smaller.

 COMPARISON: Outside functional brain MRI 3/16/2022 and outside noncontrast stereotactic head CT
 
 dated 4/11/2022 are the only images available for review at the time of interpretation.
 
 
 
 
 
 FINDINGS: Since 3/16/2022 MR, significant interval progression of expansile, T2 hyperintense signal
 
 throughout the left temporal lobe, supraorbital left frontal lobe, basal ganglia, left thalamus, and
 
 tracking across midline at the genu of the corpus callosum and fornix into the right parahippocampal
 
 gyrus, right medial temporal lobe, and right thalamus. T2 signal further tracks down the left
 
 cerebral peduncle into the midbrain and pons. Overall, these findings are consistent with
 
 infiltrating glial tumor. These components of the tumor do not demonstrate restricted diffusion or
 
 decreased ADC values. 
 
 
 
 
 
 However, there is a new focus of restricted diffusion within the lateral left pons that demonstrates
 
 mild associated mass effect and appears contiguous with the tract of abnormal T2 signal tracking
 
 along the left midbrain and pons. There is no associated enhancement. While an acute infarct could
 
 appear similar, this appearance is favored to represent a highly cellular component of the glial
 
 tumor.
 
 
 
 
 
 Overall, supratentorial mass effect from the infiltrative neoplastic process results in 8 mm of
 
 midline shift at the level of the foramen of Monro which has progressed 4/11/2022 when there was 5
 
 mm of midline shift. Midline shift results in near complete effacement of the third ventricle with
 
 interval increase in the caliber of the lateral ventricles, greater on the right, consistent with
 
 developing obstructive hydrocephalus. Furthermore, further effacement of the basilar cisterns, more
 
 notably in the region of the interpeduncular fossa with distortion of the lateral midbrain
 
 bilaterally represents some component of developing uncal herniation. Crowding of the cerebellar
 
 tonsils in the region of the foramen magnum is also increased consistent with increasing
 
 intracranial pressure.
 
 
 
 
 
 New somewhat nodular leptomeningeal enhancement tracking along the left sylvian fissure and the left
 
 middle cerebral artery (series 900/image 114) and along the supraorbital left frontal marginal gyrus
 
 leptomeninges (series 900/ image 111) is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma.
 
 
 
 
 
 Interval postprocedural changes of left temporal craniotomy and temporal lobe biopsy. New linear
 
 enhancement within the anterior left temporal lobe parenchyma likely represents postbiopsy change as
 
 it is confined to the temporal lobe adjacent to the craniotomy site, although tumor transformation
 
 not entirely excluded. Enhancement of the extracranial soft tissues overlying the left temporal
 
 craniotomy is likely reactive.
 
 
 
 
 
 No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
 
 
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval progression of diffuse infiltrating glioma brain as detailed. 
 
 2. Interval increase in the associated mass effect resulting in progressive rightward midline shift
 
 (up to 8 mm) with resultant effacement of 3rd ventricle causing mild obstructive hydrocephalus.
 
 Further effacement of the basilar cisterns and crowding of the foramen magnum consistent with
 
 increasing intracranial pressures. 
 
 3. New leptomeningeal enhancement is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma. 
 
 4. New, expansile restricted diffusion in the lateral left pons is favored for represent a component
 
 of hypercellular glial tumor, although an acute infarct could appear similar and is not entirely
 
 excluded. 
 
 5. Interval biopsy of the anterior left frontal lobe with intraparenchymal enhancement favored to
 
 represent post-biopsy change as it is confined to the region of the temporal lobe subjacent to the
 
 craniotomy. However, glial tumor transformation is not excluded. Attention at follow up is
 
 recommended.

 diffuse T2 hyperintense mass centered within the pons, slightly larger on the right, involving the 
 
 right middle cerebellar peduncle, without significant change. The mass again measures approximately 
 
 3.6 cm transverse by 2.8 cm AP on series 6 image 12. Again seen is the biopsy tract in the right 
 
 cerebellar hemisphere, and along the right lateral aspect of the mass lesion, with expected 
 
 postoperative change. The mass again causes mild deformity of the ventral aspect of the fourth 
 
 ventricle. There is no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus. However, there is mild mass effect at 
 
 the level of the foramen magnum, with inferior cerebellar tonsillar descent, as seen on series 4

 2. Post Treatment Changes: Postsurgical changes related to right-sided craniotomy for resection of
 
 a right frontal oligodendroglioma. Chronic blood products are present within the surgical resection
 
 cavity.
 
 3. Nonenhancing T2 signal changes: Nonenhancing T2 hyperintensity within the posterior right
 
 frontal lobe and parietal lobe are grossly unchanged from prior study. There may be minimal
 
 increased nonenhancing signal within the anterior right frontal lobe. Nonenhancing T2 hyperintense,
 
 T2/FLAIR hypointense multiloculated cystic component located centrally within this lesion has
 
 increased in size from prior studies and demonstrates progressive growth from November 2021 through
 
 current study. Largest cystic component measures 2.7 x 1.9 cm compared to 2 x 1.3 cm on prior study.
 
 4. Enhancement: Confluent enhancing tissue is present immediately subjacent to the craniotomy.
 
 Additional more wispy and heterogeneous soft tissue enhancement is present within the peripheral
 
 anterior portions of the lesion. These findings are unchanged from prior study.
 
 5. Perfusion: No evidence of abnormal blood volume.

 measuring approximately 14.0 x 11.11 x 6.2 cm (series 304, image 23 and series
 
 604, image 76), likely unchanged since the recent comparison ultrasound
 
 accounting for differences in imaging modality. No evidence of contrast
 
 extravasation or change in density configuration on delayed imaging to suggest
 
 active bleeding. Scattered areas of decreased perfusion in the inferior right
 
 hepatic lobe. Marked narrowing of the inferior vena cava at the anastomosis (for
 
 example series 4, image 51). 
 
 
 
 
 
 Enlarging splenomegaly since the prior CT measuring 19.0 cm, previously 15.6 cm.
 
 Multiple upper abdominal varices. Increasing mesenteric edema and scattered
 
 perienteric fluid, favored secondary to a combination of postoperative
 
 inflammation and portal enteropathy. Small amount of low density dependent free
 
 pelvic fluid. Multiple mildly prominent upper abdominal retroperitoneal lymph
 
 nodes are favored reactive. Mild diffuse body wall edema. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Redemonstrated postoperative changes of total proctocolectomy with ileoanal
 
 pouch anastomosis. Similar gaseous distention of the distal ileum about the

 obscures visualization of the lumen in several locations and may result in severe stenosis. Distal
 
 LAD appears patent, however is not well evaluated due to motion. Patent 1st and 2nd diagonal
 
 branches. Small amount of calcified plaque in the 1st diagonal branch results in likely mild
 
 stenosis, however portions of the diagonal branches are nondiagnostic due to motion.
 
 Left Circumflex: Scattered calcified atherosclerotic plaque resulting in mild-moderate stenosis
 
 proximally. Distal left circumflex not well evaluated due to small size. Dense focus of calcium in
 
 the 1st obtuse marginal branch obscures visualization of the lumen and may result in severe
 
 stenosis, however suboptimal evaluation due to motion. 
 
 Ramus intermedius: Tiny patent ramus intermedius branch
 
 Right Coronary Artery: Mild ostial stenosis due to calcified plaque. Scattered additional calcified
 
 plaque proximally resulting in likely mild stenosis. Calcified plaque in the distal right coronary
 
 artery with probable mild/moderate stenosis, however nondiagnostic due to blooming artifact from
 
 calcium and motion. Focal calcified plaque at the origin of the posterolateral branch with possible
 
 moderate stenosis. Additional scattered plaque or distally in the posterolateral branch which is

 ADDITIONAL CLINICAL HISTORY: None
 
 
 
 
 
 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 1 mm axial images were reconstructed through the chest
 
 following a single breath-hold helical acquisition during the administration of
 
 intravenous contrast material during the pulmonary arterial phase. Images were
 
 reformatted in the axial plane using maximum intensity projections to increase
 
 the conspicuity of the pulmonary circulation. 3D imaging tools were used as
 
 needed to clarify the relevant anatomy. Iodinated contrast administered
 
 intravenously.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON: None

 FINDINGS: This examination is nondiagnostic. Pulmonary embolism cannot
 
 
 
 be excluded since the IV contrast bolus was completely missed as it is
 
 
 
 already in the left heart and aorta. Either a different imaging
 
 
 
 modality or repeat CT in 24 hours (24 hour delay to protect the
