"80","","","","","","","","","","","","EXAM: CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST COMPARISON: No comparison available. FINDINGS: Exam is limited by patient positioning in extreme neck flexion. Mild compression deformities of the superior endplates of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies, without fracture line evident. These are difficult to age at CT but may be chronic. No other fracture. Several millimeters of anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and mild anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and of C5 on C6. Advanced multilevel facet arthrosis. A central disc protrusion or extrusion at C3-4 contributes along with the spondylolisthesis and posterior ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding to spinal canal stenosis and probably moderate compression of the spinal cord. Ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding is notable also at a few other levels, particularly at C2-3. Neural foraminal stenosis is advanced at left C3-4 and moderate at right C3-4. On initial scanning, at the level of C3 to the inferior endplate of C4, there was apparent hyperdensity within the spinal canal, circumferentially about the cord (for example series 8, image 47). The patient was brought back for additional scanning given the indeterminate nature of the hyperdensity after discussion with Andrea Hlady, MD, PhD (pager #11001). On repeat imaging (series 15 and 19), the hyperdensity within the spinal canal has an appearance more compatible with ligamentous redundancy rather than epidural hematoma. Calcified atheromatous plaque both carotid bifurcations. The partially visualized lung apices are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute fracture or traumatic malalignment in the cervical spine. Multi-level mild to moderate vertebral subluxations are favored to be chronic. 2. Mild superior endplate compression fractures of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies. Although their age is not entirely certain, they may be chronic. 3. Spinal canal stenosis at C3-4 should be degenerative in etiology, but there is associated spinal cord compression. The degree of this would be better evaluated with cervical spine MRI, if indicated.","Cervical Spine Fracture"

Radiation therapy completed 05/25/2022. Steroid therapy tapered to dexamethasone 1 mg QD on 10/07/2022. Left abducent palsy was again evident in October 2022, for which she initially received some steroids. Followup imaging here on November 16, 2022, confirmed tumor progression, and thus her second course of 10 fractions of radiation therapy was initiated on November 18, 2022, with completion in early December 2022. FINDINGS: Since the most recent prior examination of 11/16/2022, there has been substantial improvement in overall degree of expansion of the pons as well as spatial extent of T2 hyperintensity within the pons and superior medulla with slight interval decrease in size of the previously seen exophytic component arising from the left ventrolateral inferior pons. Overall appearance of the pons is now more similar to findings on the 08/26/2022 examination with similar appearance of the 4th ventricle which is less severely compressed than on the November exam. Previously seen prominent T1 hypointensity within the central pons noted on the November scan has resolved with the overall appearance on postcontrast T1-weighted images now appearing more similar to the August 26 examination with areas of subtle linear enhancement traversing the central and lateral pons. Overall dimensions of the mid pons as measured on image 10 series 5 at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncles is approximately 4.3 cm transverse by approximately 2.5 cm AP with comparable measurement on the earlier November scan measuring 4.6 cm transverse by 8.0 cm AP as measured on comparable anatomic image 9 of series 6 of the November scan. The change in the spatial extent of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity is most evident when comparing sagittal T2 FLAIR images slightly to the left of midline including the exophytic inferior pontine ventral component; maximal craniocaudal dimension of the T2 FLAIR signal abnormality measured approximately 3.1 cm on the November scan compared to only 1.6 cm on the current examination as measured on image 74 series 4 and approximately 1.8 cm on the August 26 examination. Stable postsurgical changes with hemosiderin staining biopsy tract again noted traversing the left cerebellar hemisphere and left middle cerebellar peduncle with termination in the left lateral aspect of the pons, where small cystic cavity is again noted. Remainder of the brain is unremarkable with no additional pathologic intracranial enhancement seen aside from stable appearing left medial frontal developmental venous anomaly. No diffusion restriction. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells as well as orbits are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Marked interval reduction in size of the expanded pons with interval reexpansion of the 4th ventricle, resolution of previously seen extensive T2 FLAIR hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity when compared to the most recent prior examination of 11/16/2022. Overall appearance of the pontine signal abnormality is now similar to the appearance on the 08/26/2022 examination, suggesting interval therapeutic response.","Glioma progression"

Status post radiation (7/2/2022-7/21/2022) with concurrent temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide. Bevacizumab initiated for radiation necrosis on 9/23/2022. Again seen is a diffuse predominantly nonenhancing T2 hyperintense tumor involving the left temporal lobe, left insula, left basal ganglia, bilateral thalamus (left significantly greater than right) and extending across the corpus callosum into the medial right temporal lobe. Since 10/20/2022, there has been further decrease in the size of the enhancing component located in the left lateral pons. T2 hyperintense signal in this region has also decreased. Elsewhere, the diffuse T2 hyperintense signal appears essentially unchanged in appearance and extent since the prior exam. Enhancing region in the left pons again appears to demonstrate increased perfusion and restricted diffusion, compatible with viable tumor. Left lateral ventricle and 3rd ventricle remain partially effaced by the expansile mass centered in the left thalamus. Ventricular calibers are stable. Minimal rightward midline shift is unchanged. Scattered bifrontal T2 hyperintense white matter foci are nonspecific, but may be treatment related. Unchanged periventricular T2 hyperintense signal. Changes related to prior stereotactic biopsy with adjacent pachymeningeal enhancement. Mild mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal sinuses. IMPRESSION: Enhancing tumor component in the left lateral pons has decreased in size since 10/20/2022, likely related to current Avastin therapy.

FINDINGS: Redemonstration of the mixed cystic and predominantly solid enhancing suprasellar glioma. The enhancing components on today's exam measure approximately 2.8 x 3.4 x 3.7 cm (AP by LR by SI) compared to 3.1 x 3.3 x 4.0 cm previously when measured in the same planes. There is notably less superior extension of the mass into the region of the third ventricle compared to the prior study with the tumor no longer encroaching upon the region of the foramina of Monro. No hydrocephalus. Furthermore, the dominant cystic portion along the inferior right aspect of the lesion adjacent to the right M1 has significantly decreased in size now measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.8 cm (AP x LR x SI) compared to 1.5 x 1.5 x 2.2 cm previously. The intratumoral cysts have minimally decreased in size as well. The mass again insinuates about and slightly splays the major anterior circle of Willis vasculature with possible minimal narrowing of the A1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries. No high-grade arterial narrowing or loss of arterial flow voids. Similar distortion and stretching of the optic pathways in the hypothalamus. The pituitary is again noted distinct from the mass and lying within the sella with a normal intrinsic T1 hyperintense neurohypophysis. The infundibulum remains obscured. The mammary bodies are posteriorly displaced. Overall similar extension into the prepontine cistern with abutment of the upper basilar artery without associated narrowing. Stable linear focus of enhancement within the posterior medulla near the apex, likely vascular in nature. Similar vascular type linear enhancement along the surface of the ventral medulla. Tiny focus of linear enhancement within a inferior left frontal sulcus (series 800/image 120) is most likely vascular in nature. No convincing leptomeningeal or intraventricular dissemination. No abnormal restricted diffusion or hemosiderin deposition. Stable probable arachnoid cyst in the right cerebellar medullary angle. Prominent retropharyngeal lymph nodes, likely reactive. Scattered paranasal sinus mucosal thickening. IMPRESSION: Overall, there has been mild interval decrease in size in both the solid and cystic components of the suprasellar glioma. Most notably the dominant cystic component along the right M1 segment has markedly decreased in size. The overall mild decrease in size of the solid component results in mildly decreased superior extension into the ventral 3rd ventricle with notably less encroachment on the region of the foramina of Monroe. No obstructive hydrocephalus or evidence of leptomeningeal dissemination.","Glioma progression"

The previously identified predominantly expansile heterogeneously enhancing glioma in the left middle cerebellar peduncle has demonstrated interval steady decrease in size since previous examinations dating back to July 2022, currently measuring 2.1 cm AP by 2.4 cm transverse by 2.1 cm craniocaudal, compared to 2.7 cm AP by 3.2 cm transverse by 2.3 cm craniocaudal on September 21, 2022, and 3.2 cm AP by 3.9 cm transverse by 2.8 cm craniocaudal on July 5, 2022, when remeasured in a similar manner. There is persistent partial effacement of the fourth ventricle but this is slightly reexpanded since the previous examinations. There is persistent increased CBV perfusion corresponding to this mass lesion. Redemonstrated is previously stereotactic biopsy tract from left occipital bone approach, with susceptibility weighted signal loss compatible with blood metabolites along the biopsy tract at the biopsy site. There are persistent areas of unenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity with mild mass effect surrounding the enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere and in the vermis, which could represent areas of edematous change versus areas of subtle unenhancing infiltrative tumor. These findings are stable. The ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are otherwise normal in size, shape and position. Tiny focus of restricted diffusion is identified within the aforementioned mass lesion, but this could be related to blood metabolites (series 6, image 71). A small patchy focus of unenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity is identified in the periventricular white matter surrounding the left frontal horn extending into the left external/extreme capsule region (series 20, image 15), which is nonspecific but could represent a small focus of chronic demyelination or gliosis. Mild nodular mucosal thickening is present of the paranasal sinuses.

Radiation treatment completed 10/21/2022. Undergoing research protocol chemotherapy. FINDINGS: Overall increased extent of heterogeneous enhancement surrounding the resection cavity compared to 08/31/2022 MRI, most pronounced along the superior and posterior resection margins (best seen in series 20 image 49, 40). Abnormally elevated rCBV associated with the enhancements in the superior and posterior resection cavity margins. Possible additional increased rCBV the at the anterior resection margins (series 1369 image 56), not definitive due to adjacent vasculature. Increasing 3-6 mm nodular foci of enhancements in the right occipital lobe (series 19 image 59, 61), in the right parietal lobe (series 19 image 82, 78), in the splenium of the corpus callosum (series 19 image 81, 87), and at the callososeptal interface (series 19 image 90). Mildly increased rCBV associated with some of the lesions in the right occipital lobe and in splenium of the corpus callosum. Previously seen superimposed non-masslike enhancements in the splenium of the corpus callosum has decreased since prior study. Increasing extent of T2 hyperintensity surrounding the resection cavity along the right anterior temporal, inferior parietal and right occipital lobe. Unchanged additional small T2 hyperintensity in the right lateral parietal lobe (series 10 image 29) again could be a separate focus of glioma. No significant mass effect or midline shift. Expected evolving infarct in the right occipital lobe with decreased enhancement.

FINDINGS: Combination of the tumor and radiation treatment (gamma knife) protocols was utilized. Abnormal exam. Recent postoperative changes are present from a right frontal lobe approach stereotactic biopsy of the patient's known right thalamic mass lesion with small amount of postoperative blood products on susceptibility weighted images along the biopsy tract and at the mass lesion (intrinsic T1 weighted images within the mass lesion). Examination reveals interval slightly progressed lobulated, heterogeneous nodular enhancement within the previously present intra-axial mass lesion in the right thalamic lobe, pathologically proven Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade 4. Immunostains are positive for GFAP, ATRX and p53 (mutation staining pattern), and negative for IDH1, CD20 and CD45. The heterogeneous areas of enhancement within the mass lesion currently measured 3.3 cm AP by 2.2 cm transverse by 2.1 cm craniocaudal, and is more confluent than November 2, 2022., At which time it measured 2.7 cm AP by 1.7 cm transverse by 1.7 cm craniocaudal when remeasured in a similar manner. There is surrounding unenhancing T2/or hyperintensity which is essentially circumscribed of the right thalamic lobe associated to this lesion. There is partial effacement of the right lateral ventricle, with approximately 2 mm subfalcine herniation of the right thalamic lobe into the left, but without evidence of associated hydrocephalus. Previously identified focus of abnormal cortical/subcortical thickening with T2/FLAIR hyperintensity is redemonstrated in the right superior parietal lobule (series 15, image 166), with increased signal on diffusion images but no evidence of true restricted diffusion. There is a faint focus of curvilinear leptomeningeal enhancement overlying this lesion (series 18, image 170), which could represent a focus of associated leptomeningeal spread of these are process or could represent a small enhancing vessel. This focus of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity is stable since November 2, 2022, but is slightly more confluent than September 19, 2022. I believe this represents another focus of glioma, given the patient's primary diagnosis. I do not see evidence of signal abnormality within the insula in these images. No additional significant interval changes are demonstrated. Mild mucosal thickening is present of the paranasal sinuses. IMPRESSION: 1. Interval slightly progressive heterogeneous enhancement in the right thalamic mass lesion concerning for tumor progression, although there are associated recent blood metabolites associated with a biopsy. 2. Previously identified cortical/subcortical unenhancing lesion is redemonstrated in the right inferior parietal lobule, with a surrounding focus of faint curvilinear enhancement in the leptomeningeal surface. This finding is more confluent than September 19, 2022 and probably represents another focus of glioma. 3.

COMPARISON: Outside brain MRI 10/21/2022 FINDINGS: Since 10/21/2022, significant interval increase in size of the now peripherally enhancing (and centrally nonenhancing) mass in the anteromedial right temporal lobe with the enhancing component now measuring 4.3 x 3.4 x 3.8 cm (AP x RL x SI), previously measuring 1.6 x 1.3 x 1.4 cm. The enhancing tissue now extends into the right subinsular region. Furthermore, T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal about the enhancing component of the lesion has markedly increased as well with abnormal signal extending into the posterior right parahippocampal gyrus, deep posterior temporal lobe, subinsular white matter as well as involving the right basal ganglia and right internal capsule. Notably, the abnormal T2 signal does not extend across the corpus callosum nor traverse across the anterior commissure. Focally increased perfusion within the anterosuperior enhancing components of the lesion, whereas the remaining vast majority of the lesion demonstrates decreased perfusion. No associated restricted diffusion. Internal foci of susceptibility consistent with blood products. Overall mass effect results in local regional sulcal effacement, partial effacement of the right lateral ventricle, and 6 mm of leftward midline shift at the level of the septum pellucidum. There is a moderate degree of uncal herniation partially distorting the right middle cerebral peduncle. The left lateral ventricle is mildly enlarged, and has slightly increased in caliber since 10/21/2022 indicating possible early obstructive hydrocephalus versus redistribution of CSF from the now effaced right lateral ventricle. Mildly expansile T2 hyperintense signal in the subcortical left frontal lobe remains relatively stable to minimally increased since 10/21/2022. However, there is a new 2 mm nodular focus of enhancement at the gray-white junction within inferior aspect of the region of abnormal T2 signal (series 25/image 75 and series 26/image 82). Mildly increased regional perfusion. No associated restricted diffusion. Wispy linear enhancement in the superior right frontal gyrus (series 25 images 127-130 and series 26/images 72-74) not seen previously (possibly due to technical factors/motion). No associated T2 signal abnormality. This may be a benign vascular lesion given lack of associated T2 signal abnormality. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. Scattered paranasal sinus mucosal thickening. Opacification of a majority of the right mastoid and pneumatized temporal bone air cells. No calvarial or skull base lesions. Extracranial soft tissues are unremarkable. Findings were discussed with Kathy Baule APRN, DNP (24016) at 3:00 PM on 11/11/2022. IMPRESSION: 1. Rapidly enlarging infiltrative mass in the medial right temporal lobe with imaging features and temporal evolution suggestive of high-grade glioma, although metastasis cannot be excluded. This is further confounded by the relatively stable T2/FLAIR signal in the remote left frontal lobe with tiny nodule of enhancement as multifocal metastases are statistically more likely than multifocal glioma. Regardless, tissue sampling will be required for final diagnosis. 2. Locoregional mass effect resulting in 6 mm of new leftward midline shift and mild uncal herniation partially compressing the right cerebral peduncle. 3. Mildly enlarged left lateral ventricle may represent early entrapment versus CSF redistribution from the effaced right lateral ventricle.","Glioma progression"

A subtle hazyarea of nonenhancing T2 hyperintense signal in the right anteromesial frontal lobe (series 300 image127) probably represents contralateral hemisphere, multifocal glioma.Focal areas of masslike contrast enhancement within the larger area of T2 hyperintense signal aregenerally mildly larger than 6 days ago, and two of these, within the left anterior and inferomedialtemporal lobe, have become necrotic (these measure 12 and 14 mm diameter, respectively). Othersmaller areas of contrast enhancement at the inferior left basal ganglia, in the left hypothalamus,the left anterior temporal stem, the posteromedial left temporal lobe, and the left middle temporalgyrus. The masslike swelling of the left temporal lobe effaces the left ambient cistern and the temporalhorn of the left lateral ventricle, and the frontal horn and body of the left lateral ventricle aremildly partially effaced, new since 2016.Moderate leukoaraiosis in the cerebral hemispheric white matter and central pons. Generalizedcerebral and cerebellar volume loss.IMPRESSION:Infiltrative-appearing partially contrast-enhancing abnormality centered in the lefttemporal lobe most likely represents a diffuse astrocytoma, most suspicious for glioblastoma. Therehas been progression of multifocal enhancing necrotic areas within the overall lesion since 6 daysago. The presumed glioma is also most likely multifocal, involving the right anterior frontal lobe.","Glioma progression"

T2 signal further tracks down the leftcerebral peduncle into the midbrain and pons. Overall, these findings are consistent withinfiltrating glial tumor. These components of the tumor do not demonstrate restricted diffusion ordecreased ADC values. However, there is a new focus of restricted diffusion within the lateral left pons that demonstratesmild associated mass effect and appears contiguous with the tract of abnormal T2 signal trackingalong the left midbrain and pons. There is no associated enhancement. While an acute infarct couldappear similar, this appearance is favored to represent a highly cellular component of the glialtumor.Overall, supratentorial mass effect from the infiltrative neoplastic process results in 8 mm ofmidline shift at the level of the foramen of Monro which has progressed 4/11/2022 when there was 5mm of midline shift. Midline shift results in near complete effacement of the third ventricle withinterval increase in the caliber of the lateral ventricles, greater on the right, consistent withdeveloping obstructive hydrocephalus. Furthermore, further effacement of the basilar cisterns, morenotably in the region of the interpeduncular fossa with distortion of the lateral midbrainbilaterally represents some component of developing uncal herniation. Crowding of the cerebellartonsils in the region of the foramen magnum is also increased consistent with increasingintracranial pressure.New somewhat nodular leptomeningeal enhancement tracking along the left sylvian fissure and the leftmiddle cerebral artery (series 900/image 114) and along the supraorbital left frontal marginal gyrusleptomeninges (series 900/ image 111) is highly suspicious for leptomeningeal spread of glioma.Interval postprocedural changes of left temporal craniotomy and temporal lobe biopsy.

Since the July 2022, there is no substantial change in size or appearance of the mass. The mass demonstrates focal central susceptibility, and minimal to no enhancement. Its location involves the right 3rd nerve nucleus. There is no involvement of the tectal plate. No hydrocephalus. The previous CT of April 2021 demonstrates a focal central calcification, corresponding to the susceptibility and slight intrinsic T1 hyperintensity seen on the current exam The mass demonstrates considerably increased CBV, however on spectroscopy, there is no evidence for elevated choline. Low to intermediate ADC values are noted in the tumor. IMPRESSION: The MRI findings appear to be most consistent with a glioma of midbrain.

BRIEF HISTORY: On 02/14/2020, a right frontal craniotomy was performed for resection of right frontal lobe WHO grade 2 astrocytoma. The tumor was IDH mutant, but no 1p/19 q co-deletion or TERT promoter mutation. The patient is currently on observation. FINDINGS: Redemonstrated are postoperative changes of right frontal craniotomy. In association there is increased pachymeningeal enhancement over the right frontal convexity and along the anterior falx cerebri, unchanged. Nonenhancing, confluent T2 signal hyperintensity along the margins of the anteromedial right frontal resection bed and extending across the callosal genu to the left frontal periventricular white matter is not detectably changed in comparison with the most recent study of 06/06/2020. However, this demonstrates gradual progression when comparing across serial examinations dating back to 09/14/2021. This may represent evolving postoperative gliosis. However, very gradual progression of nonenhancing glioma remains an alternate possibility, particularly given involvement of the corpus callosum and left frontal lobe. Continued clinical and imaging follow-up is recommended. Irregular enhancement within the right frontal resection cavity remains most consistent with postoperative changes and is stable. No sites of new contrast enhancement are identified. Ventricular size is stable with mild ex vacuo dilatation of the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle. The brain is otherwise normal. No evidence of diffusion restriction. Mild ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening. Prominent bilateral level II cervical lymph nodes are likely reactive in nature. IMPRESSION: 1. T2 signal hyperintensity along the margins of the right frontal resection bed and extending across the corpus callosum to the left frontal periventricular white matter is not detectably changed in comparison with the most recent study of 06/06/2022 but demonstrates gradual progression when reviewed over serial exams dating back to 09/14/2021. It is unclear whether this represents evolving postoperative gliosis or slow progression of nonenhancing tumor. Continued clinical and imaging follow-up is recommended.","Glioma progression"

CHEMOTHERAPY: Currently on adjuvant therapy with a dasatinib and everolimus. Postoperative changes right craniectomy with subtotal resection and cranioplasty in the right temporal lobe. Similar appearance of the resection cavity with continued decrease in minimal postoperative enhancement (for example series 15, image 80 compared with series 15, image 71 on the prior exam). Small amount of linear enhancement within the adjacent anterior right temporal lobe (series 15, image 82-84) is not substantially changed across multiple studies. No new areas of enhancement or diffusion restriction. No elevated relative cerebral blood volume on perfusion weighted image. Stable T2 hyperintense, mildly expansile signal surrounding the resection cavity with extension into the medial temporal lobe, inferolateral right frontal lobe, and right frontal centrum semiovale. Minimally increased dural enhancement underlying the craniotomy (for example series 15, image 122), which may be due to slight differences in image acquisition and is likely postoperative. The small extra-axial collection over the right frontal lobe has remained stable in size with continued slight increase in FLAIR signal, again most likely representing proteinaceous content. No evidence of associated restricted diffusion. Old right frontal shunt tract. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

FINDINGS: Extensive epidermoid tumor in the posterior fossa, just above the right leaf of the tentorium and in the deep tendon portions of the lateral ventricles is similar in appearance compared to the most recent MRI and has demonstrated a slight interval progression since March 2021. Tumor is most evident as lobulated areas of restricted diffusion in the affected regions including ventral to the pons where there is mass effect on the pontomedullary junction encasement of the distal vertebral basilar system, in the cerebellopontine angle cisterns bilaterally where there is compression of the upper pons and midbrain, just above the right leaf of the tentorium along the posterior right temporal lobe and in the deep dependent portions of the lateral ventricles. These same regions demonstrate heterogeneous hyperintensity to CSF on the FLAIR sequence. There is no significant enhancement. There is an enlarging T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion in the left caudate head now measuring 12 x 12 x 8 mm (RL, AP, SI; previously 11 x 12 x 7 mm).

FINDINGS: According to the radiation oncology note dated 8/29/2022, the patient has ""an astrocytic glioma with piloid features with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion and NF1 mutation, no BRAF mutation involving the left cerebellum s/p subtotal resection on 5/24/22 with a secondary low-grade glioma radiographically involving the left frontal lobe, undergoing radiation therapy with temozolomide"". Redemonstrated are post biopsy changes from a left paramedian suboccipital burr hole approach for patient's left cerebellar intra-axial mass lesion with heterogeneous enhancement. There are associated hemorrhagic moieties on susceptibility weighted images along the biopsy tract in the left cerebellar hemisphere. In the interval, there has been progressive confluence of heterogeneous abnormal enhancement in the left cerebellar hemisphere predominantly centered in the left middle cerebellar peduncle, but extends superiorly and inferiorly into the left cerebellar hemisphere. The areas of heterogeneous enhancement currently measure 5.1 cm AP (series 17, image 9) by 3.7 cm transverse by 4.1 cm craniocaudal (series 18, image 34), compared to 3.2 cm AP by 2.4 cm transverse by 3.4 cm craniocaudal when remeasured in a similar manner on June 30, 2022. There is slightly progressive effacement of the fourth ventricle, although there is no evidence of frank hydrocephalus at present. There is, however, mild persistent dilatation of the aqueduct of Sylvius, with stable appearance. There is additional interval new unenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the left lateral posterior margins of the medulla, pons, and left middle cerebellar peduncle which are somewhat sharply delineated. These findings might represent post radiation changes. Previously identified cortical/subcortical unenhancing mass lesion in the anterior margin of the left middle frontal gyrus (series 18, image 146 on MRI dated June 30, 2022) has diminished in size in conspicuity in the current examination (series 15, image 26), currently measuring 7 mm AP by 5 mm transverse. The ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are otherwise normal in size, shape and position. There is a cavum Verga without evidence of lateral bulging walls. The diffusion-weighted images reveal no abnormal restricted diffusion. The perfusion images reveal hypoperfusion corresponding to the areas of signal abnormality in the left-sided posterior fossa. These findings could be explained on the basis of radiation changes. The perfusion images in the previously identified juxtacortical focus in the left frontal lobe do not demonstrate gross evidence of increased or decreased CBV perfusion, but this area is suboptimal for evaluation for perfusion images due to the close proximity to the superficial vascular structures. IMPRESSION: 1. Interval progressive mass effect and heterogeneous enhancement involving the patient's known mass lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with a slightly progressive effacement of the fourth ventricle but no hydrocephalus at present. These findings have no associated increased CBV perfusion and could be explained on the basis of post radiation changes. 2. Interval diminished size of previously identified focal mass lesion in the left juxtacortical frontal lobe.","Glioma progression"

"296","","","","","","","","","","","","Indications: headache;brainORIGINAL REPORT - 01-Dec-2010 23:38:00MR Brain W/O:MRA Head WO/CST:MR Venogram Head WO/CST:IMPRESSION:#1. Findings suggest that the patient may have experienced recent intraventricular hemorrhage involving the left lateral ventricle. It is advised that the patient undergo noncontrast head CT (with appropriate lead shielding of her gravid uterus) to better characterize whether the abnormality within the body of the left lateral ventricle is an organized clot. In addition, lumbar puncture for CSF analysis would be useful.#2. Intracranial MRA and MRV are negative.FINDINGS:MRI HEAD: An approximate 0.7 cm area of lobulated T1 shortening is identified within the body of the left lateral ventricle. This demonstrates blooming on the gradient-echo sequence raising concern for the presence of hemosiderin. There also appears to be some asymmetric magnetic susceptibility within the choroid plexus of the left lateral ventricle. Although a punctate focus of susceptibility in the occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle is nonspecific, there appears to be susceptibility lining the ependyma within the left occipital horn and also within the left frontal horn. This constellation of findings raises concern for the presence of previous intraventricular hemorrhage. Since IV contrast was not not administered due to the patient's pregnancy, it is not entirely clear whether the lobulated abnormality in the left lateral ventricle is organized clot versus potentially a small hemorrhagic mass based along the septum pellucidum. A noncontrast head CT might be useful in making this distinction. No hydrocephalus is present. On the FLAIR sequence, there is no evidence of gross subarachnoid hemorrhage, though there may be a tiny amount of blood or proteinaceous material dependently in the occipital horns. Incidental note is made of the anatomic variant of ""partially empty sella.""INTRACRANIAL MRA: Intracranial arteries appear normal. No evidence of aneurysm. With attention directed to the left lateral ventricle, there is no evidence of enlarged choroidal branches to conclusively suggest the presence of abnormal arteriovenous shunting. Bright signal within the body of the left lateral ventricle and in the left choroid plexus is related to intrinsic T1 shortening rather than representing flow-related enhancement.INTRACRANIAL MRV: No evidence of dural sinus thrombosis. The loss of signal within the distal transverse and sigmoid sinuses bilaterally is likely related to de-phasing. There is no abnormal signal in these areas on the FLAIR sequences to suggest the presence of thrombus.TECHNIQUE: Before taking the patient into the MRI suite, I had a detailed discussion with the patient and her husband regarding the fact that the neurology service has requested MR imaging of her head in the context of a second trimester pregnancy. I explained under these circumstances we would not be administering any intravenous contrast. We discussed that there are no large randomized controlled trials to unequivocally document the safety of MRI during the second trimester of pregnancy because of these types of studies using healthy subjects cannot be ethically performed. However, there is no compelling evidence that noncontrast MRI in gravid patients, including the population undergoing dedicated fetal MRI, has a deleterious effect on the fetus. Given the slight uncertainty that still exists because of lack of large prospective randomized controlled trials, I explained that we scrutinize all requests for MRI during pregnancy to make certain that this imaging modality is being used in a judicious fashion. In her case, the presence of a new severe headache raises concern for a number of acute intracranial processes which could potentially be life-threatening. As a result, based on the evaluation of potential benefits versus minimal theoretical risk, the patient and her husband requested that we proceed with performing the MRI.Brain MRI was performed using sagittal T1, axial T2, axial diffusion, axial gradient echo, and 3D CUBE FLAIR sequences. Axial 3D time of flight intracranial MRA was performed. Sagittal phase contrast MRV was acquired. Maximum intensity projection images of the vascular imaging were generated.COMPARISON: None AvailableThis report has been electronically signed by Hoxworth, Joseph MD on Dec1 2010 11:37PM.Electronically signed by:Joseph Hoxworth MD 01-Dec-2010 23:38*** APPENDED REPORT *** - 14-Dec-2010 14:18:00*** APPENDED REPORT *** 12/09/2010 20:34:10Image reallocated to accession no. 542332304-1 at Dec9 20108:34PMThis report has been electronically signed by Hoxworth, Joseph MD on Dec 14 20102:17PM.Electronically signed by:Joseph Hoxworth MD 14-Dec-2010 14:18","Intracranial hemorrhage"

Limited exam.2. Subacute subdural hematoma on the right has increased and showsmild subfalcine herniation.3. Constellation of findings on the most recent CT scans most likelyrepresent sequela of intracranial hemorrhage status post fall.Clinical findings discussed with Dr. Holtz by telephone at 1509 on8/9/2016. Findings also discussed with Dr. Singh in person at 1536 on8/9/2016.FINDINGS: Limited exam due to patient cooperativity; patient refusedto complete post gadolinium images.Limited imaging show a right-sided subdural collection. This is T1low/intermediate intensity and T2/FLAIR low/intermediate intensity.This does not show restricted diffusion. In greatest axial depth thismeasures 6-7 mm. There are 6 mm of right to left midline shift. Thebasilar cisterns are widely patent; no uncal herniation. Allowing fordifferences in modality, this appears to have increased since7/25/2016, when it was relatively inconspicuous, and is notdefinitely seen 7/24/2016. By imaging and temporal characteristics,this probably represents subacute subdural hematoma. Slow venousbleeding is difficult to exclude given the change over time.Previously noted free flowing intraventricular hemorrhage appears tohave resolved. Ventricular caliber is stable respect to the priorexam; no new hydrocephalus. T2 signal and blooming in theanteromedial left temporal lobe consistent with sequela of smallintraparenchymal hematoma. Small nodule again seen along theepididymal surface of the frontal horn of left lateral ventricle.This is T2 hyperintense and show susceptibility on gradient imagesand may represent a calcified subpleural nodule (series 6/9, image28). Although findings are not specific for this probably representsan area of residual hemosiderin in the setting of recentintraventricular blood; calcified subpleural nodule is not excludedalthough less favored is this would be an uncommon finding to developin a patient of this age. Additional areas of blooming are seen alongthe superior aspect of the septum pellucidum on the right also likelyrepresenting residual blood product (versus less likelycalcification) in the setting of recent intraventricular hemorrhage.In short, constellation of findings on the most recent CT scans mostlikely represent sequela of intracranial hemorrhage status post fall.RAD^^^AUMR Brain w/o contrast8/9/2016 14:00:00","Intracranial hemorrhage"

The central and proximal bilateral pulmonary arteries are within normal dimensions. AORTA: Left-sided aortic arch with conventional three-vessel branching pattern. Dilatation of the aortic root, minimal dimension = 45 mm (right to left coronary sinuses), and ascending aorta, maximal dimension = 48 mm at the mid level. The prior chest CTAs were ungated with motion at the aortic root level, however, with side by side comparison, the mid ascending aorta appears to have slightly increased in size since 2011 (approximately 45 mm) and relatively stable since 2017 (approximately 47 mm). Aortic dimensions return to normal at the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. Patent proximal arch vessels. Mild calcified and noncalcified plaques primarily involving the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. No aortic dissection or coarctation. Incidentally seen, patent proximal celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. Stable ectatic changes of the proximal celiac artery.CORONARY ARTERIES: Origins/course: Conventional coronary origins. Dominance: Right dominant systemDense coronary calcifications involving the distal left main, proximal to distal LAD, proximal circumflex and throughout the RCA preclude accurate assessment of coronary artery stenosis. If coronary artery anatomic assessment is indicated, consider alternative imaging modality, such as invasive coronary angiogram. OTHER CARDIAC FINDINGS: Normal left ventricular chamber size and preserved systolic function. Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, maximal myocardial thickness = 16 mm at the basal anteroseptal wall. Left ventricular outflow tract is widely patent. No left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities or resting myocardial perfusion defect. Borderline dilated right ventricular chamber with preserved systolic function. Normal biatrial chamber size. Thickened mitral leaflets without abnormal systolic anterior motion. Tricuspid aortic valve. No pericardial effusion. No left ventricular, left atrial or left atrial appendage thrombus. No evidence of anomalous pulmonary venous return. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:Cholecystectomy. Right renal cyst. Calcified granuloma in the left lower lobe. Small calcified mediastinal lymph nodes. Mild bibasilar scarring. No pleural effusion. Old compression fracture of the T12 vertebral body. IMPRESSION:1. No evidence of acute or chronic pulmonary embolism. Widely patent and nondilated central and proximal bilateral pulmonary arteries. 2. Borderline right ventricular enlargement with preserved systolic function. Normal left ventricular size and reserve systolic function. 3. Dense multivessel coronary calcifications involving the left main, proximal to distal LAD, proximal circumflex and throughout the RCA preclude accurate assessment of coronary artery stenosis. If anatomic assessment is indicated, consider alternative imaging modality, such as invasive coronary angiogram.4. No acute pulmonary airspace disease or effusion. 5. Fusiform dilatation of the ascending aorta, maximal dimension of 48 mm at the mid level.","Pulmonary Embolism"

The thoracic aorta is upper normal caliber. Theheart is enlarged. Hypoattenuating mass in the region of the rightatrioventricular groove extending around the root of the aorta and proximalascending aorta similar to previous, known paraganglioma.There is no significant pleural or pericardial effusion. No acute airspaceopacity or evidence of edema.No pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymph nodesidentified.Visualized portions of the upper abdominal viscera demonstrate no acuteabnormality. Cholelithiasis again noted. Hypoattenuating lateral left renalcortical lesion similar to previous, prior study density compatible with a cyst.No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion identified.IMPRESSION: Negative for acute pulmonary embolism. Hypoattenuating rightatrioventricular groove mass, known paraganglioma, extending around the aorticroot/proximal ascending aorta appears similar to prior allowing for differencesin modality/technique.

There is a 7 mm lytic lesion at the inferior angle of the right scapula without associated fracture. No overlying soft tissue abnormality. This probably accounts for patient's pain.2. Multiple other lytic lesions, some associated with fracture, including the bilateral ribs, right clavicular head, and T5 vertebral body.3. There is a 2.5 cm consolidation within the right upper lobe; this has likely been stable since at least 3/31/2017. Appearance is typical of fungal infection such as coccidioidomycosis. Recommend correlation with prior cross-sectional imaging. If none is available, correlation with coccidioidomycosis titers and CT follow-up in 3-6 months could be performed.CLINICAL HISTORY: Right scapular pain; history of multiple myeloma.CT THORAX WITH IV DYE TECHNIQUE: Overlapping axial images are reconstructed through the chest following a single breath hold helical acquisition. Iodinated contrast was administered intravenously; see PowerChart for the amounts and type of iodinated contrast media administered and wasted.3-D images including sagittal multiplanar reconstructions and axial maximum intensity projection reconstructions were performed on the scanner under general physician supervision. These reconstructions were performed to clarify relevant anatomy as well as to increase sensitivity for pulmonary nodules.COMPARISON: Skeletal survey, 5/3/2018; bone survey, 3/31/2017.FINDINGS:Bones: There is a 7 mm lytic lesion at the inferior angle of the right scapula. No associated fracture.Prior anterolateral right second, lateral left fourth, and lateral left fifth rib fracture; there are associated lytic lesions with the left-sided rib fractures, suggesting multiple myeloma involvement.Large lytic lesion of the right clavicular head with associated fracture. Lytic lesion at the left posterior lateral aspect of the T5 vertebral body.Ossific nonunion of the T8 spinous process tip; congenital versus sequela of prior trauma. No associated lytic lesion.Chest Wall: No lymphadenopathy.Abdomen: Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.Mediastinum: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. No mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. No pericardial abnormality. Right internal jugular port with tip at cavoatrial junction.Pleura: No significant pleural abnormality.Lungs:There is a 25 x 14 mm consolidation within the right upper lobe with adjacent satellite nodularity (series 3, image #32). In retrospect, this is likely present on prior skeletal survey (3/31/2017). Given the differences of modality, this is difficult to categorize as completely stable. Appearance is typical of granulomatous infection such as coccidioidomycosis. There is an associated perihilar calcified lymph node.There multiple other, smaller nodes, predominantly in a centrilobular distribution, noted throughout the lungs. For example, a 5 mm nodule in the anterior right upper lobe (series 3, image #48) and a 4 mm lymph node within the left lower lobe (series 3, image #81).The lungs are otherwise clear, no pneumonia or edema.No significant pleural fluid or pneumothorax identified.John Renfrew M.D.I have reviewed the images and report and concur with these findingsElectronically signed by:P.

There is mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy, slightly increased from prior CT. For example, there is a right paratracheal lymph node measuring 0.2 cm short axis (series 5, image 49) and a precarinal lymph node measuring 11 mm short axis (image 53). Mild left hilar adenopathy measuring up to 7 mm short axis, not significantly changed (image 64). No axillary lymphadenopathy. Esophagus collapsed and poorly evaluated.Apical scarring in bronchiectasis not significantly changed. There is ground glass opacification in the right middle lobe, measuring 2.7 cm craniocaudad (series 6B, image 70). There are multifocal groundglass nodules in the right lower lobe with consolidation posteriorly. There are also multifocal groundglass opacities in the base of the left lower lobe. Basilar opacities were seen on the comparison CT. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.Mild degenerative changes in the lower thoracic spine.

Images of the abdomen were also obtained given the patient's known abdominal aortic aneurysm.COMPARISON:Retroperitoneal ultrasound 12/04/2012. Chest radiograph 04/07/2008.SUMMARY:1. No pulmonary embolism.2. No penetrating aortic ulcer or aortic dissection.3. No significant visualized coronary artery stenosis, although evaluation is limited secondary to coronary artery calcifications.4. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3 cm, minimally enlarged versus stable from the ultrasound of 12/04/2012 given differences in modality/technique.5. Indeterminate pulmonary nodules. See follow-up guidelines below.6. Small right adrenal nodule likely represents an adenoma, but is technically indeterminate. Dedicated CT or MRI may be helpful for further evaluation.FINDINGS: The exam is negative for acute aortic dissection or acute aortic injury. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.0 cm (series 5 image 138). This measures slightly larger than the comparison ultrasound, but may be secondary to differences in modality/technique. No CT evidence of aneurysmal rupture. Due to delayed scanning of the abdomen, the patency of the abdominal aorta and its visceral branches is not well evaluated on this exam, however there does appear to be any gross marked stenosis. Moderate aortoiliac atherosclerotic disease.CORONARY ARTERIES:Evaluation of patency of the coronary arteries is limited secondary to coronary artery calcification.Dominance: Right coronary artery dominance.Left Main Coronary: Mild plaque without significant stenosis.Left Anterior Descending: Mild to moderate atherosclerotic plaque without significant stenosis, although atherosclerotic calcification limits visualization. The 1st and 2nd diagonal branches appear patent.Left circumflex: Moderate atherosclerotic plaque without significant stenosis, although calcification limits visualization. The 1st obtuse marginal is patent.Right coronary artery: Moderate atherosclerotic plaque with possible moderate narrowing (less than 70 %) of the proximal and mid RCA. The distal RCA and visualized 1st marginal branch appear patent.No gross regional wall motion abnormalities on cine images. Mild thinning of the myocardium at the cardiac apex. No gross visualized perfusion defects of the myocardium. Mild thickening of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve.ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:Emphysematous changes in the lungs, most marked in the upper lobes. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The tracheobronchial tree is patent. Linear scarring in the lingula.There are several small indeterminate pulmonary nodules in both lungs, the largest of which measures 5 mm in the anterior right middle lobe (series 4 image 163), and 5-6 mm in the lateral right lower lobe (series 4 image 150), and 5 mm in the lateral left lower lobe (series 4 image 181).Diffuse hepatic steatosis. Low-attenuation nodule within the right adrenal gland (series 5 image 73) most likely represents a adrenal adenoma, but is technically indeterminate (Hounsfield units 34). Contrast within the renal collecting systems secondary to mild delay in scanning of the abdomen.

Postoperative course was complicated by pulmonary embolism and surgical site infection. On 12/06/2022, the surgical site was debrided with removal of right frontal bone flap and synthetic dural graft. Surgical site drain was removed and patient dismissed on 12/13/2022 on vancomycin and cefepime. Chemoradiation deferred. The prior MRI demonstrated progression of enhancement associated with the right frontal grade 3 astrocytoma, which includes involvement of the bilateral frontal lobes, anterior corpus callosum, and septum pellucidum. Allowing for the limitations of different modality and noncontrast CT technique, nothing convincing for tumor progression. Also no convincing change in the infiltrative low-attenuation changes (tumor and/or edema about the resection bed), including in the right caudate. No hemorrhage; blood products in the cavity seen on a 12/13/2022 CT have resolved. No change in mass effect, including effacement of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.

Thesystemic venous return drains normally (inferior caval vein 26 mm, superiorcaval vein 21 mm) to a severely-dilated right atrium (end-systolic area 28 cm2and volume 63 ml/m2) with intact interatrial septum. The tricuspid valve appearsnormal with probable mild central regurgitation. The right ventricle is mild tomoderately dilated with mild to moderate global systolic dysfunction but intactinterventricular septum, presenting a normal curvature. Ill-defined, polylobularmobile right ventricular intracavitary masses are suspected, appearing isointense to myocardium in cinematic, T2w STIR and T1w spin echo. Gadoliniumenhanced first-pass perfusion study and late enhancement images suggest nouptake, in keeping with thrombus. In comparison to the echo images, the massbulk appears less although caution must be exerted in trans-modality comparisonwith different spatial and temporal resolution. The quantitative values measuredfor the right ventricle are as follows:Right ventricular ejection fraction: 41%Right ventricular end-diastolic volume: 301 ml (139 ml/m2)Right ventricular end-systolic volume: 178 ml (82 ml/m2)Right ventricular ejection volume: 123 ml/beatCardiac index: 4.48 l/min/m2The right ventricular outflow tract appears patent with grossly normal pulmonaryvalve function. The central pulmonary artery dimensions appear at upper limitsof normal (main 29.5 mm, right 21 mm, left 21.5mm) with suspicion ofintraluminal segmental filling defects as seen by contrast-enhanced CT. Nopleural effusion is seen with a tiny pericardial effusion anterior to the rightventricle. No mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal nodules ormasses are seen.The pulmonary venous return drains normally to a severely-dilated left atrium(end-systolic antero-posterior diameter 41 mm and volume 95 ml/m2) with nothrombus seen. The mitral valve appears normal with no regurgitation seen. Theleft ventricular volumes, systolic function and mass appear normal with noregional wall motion abnormality or thrombus. No pre-contrast myocardial signalabnormality was seen. There was no evidence of abnormal late Gadoliniumenhancement (LGE). The quantitative values measured for the left ventricle areas follows:Left ventricular ejection fraction: 54%Left ventricular end-diastolic volume: 194 ml (90 ml/m2)Left ventricular end-systolic volume: 89 ml (41 ml/m2)Left ventricular ejection volume: 105 ml/beatCardiac index: 3.83 l/min/m2Left ventricular mass: 181 g (84 g/m2)The left ventricular outflow tract appears patent with grossly normal aorticvalve function. The thoracic aortic dimensions appear normal with no evidence ofaneurysm or coarctation. Representative measurements of the thoracic aorta areas follows: Sinuses of Valsalva: 35.5 mm Tubular ascending aorta: 36.5 mm Distal ascending aorta: 31.5 mmProximal descending aorta: 26.5 mm Mid-descending aorta: 26 mm Pre-diaphragmatic aorta: 27 mm.CONCLUSIONS:1. Ill-defined, polylobular mobile right ventricular intracavitary masses aresuspected, appearing isointense to myocardium in cinematic, T2w STIR and T1wspin echo. Gadolinium enhanced first-pass perfusion study and late enhancementimages suggest no uptake, in keeping with thrombus. In comparison to the echoimages, the mass bulk appears less than seen yesterday by echo, although cautionmust be exerted in trans-modality comparison with different spatial and temporalresolution.2. The central pulmonary artery dimensions appear at upper limits of normalwith suspicion of intraluminal segmental thrombotic filling defects as seen bycontrast-enhanced CT yesterday.3. The right ventricle is mild to moderately dilated with mild to moderateglobal systolic dysfunction but intact interventricular septum, presenting anormal curvature. Severely-dilated right atrium with intact interatrial septumand probable mild central tricuspid regurgitation.4. Severely-dilated left atrium with normal mitral valve function. The leftventricular volumes, systolic function and mass appear normal with no regionalwall motion abnormality, thrombus or pre-contrast signal abnormality was seen.There was no evidence of abnormal late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE).CLINICAL CORRELATION:The right ventricular tissue characterization suggests thrombi with probabledecrease in bulk size on intravenous heparin.IMPRESSION:Right ventricular intracavitary lesion correlating with echocardiography, midcavity near applicable muscles and showing some mobility on perfusion imaging,not well characterized given gating artifact but presumably reflecting embolicmaterial given the evidence of pulmonary embolism on the recent CT scan in thepossible slight decrease in size during treatment of this lesion on the currentstudy compared to the prior CT.No clear or convincing regional wall motion abnormalities involving the leftventricle, although gating artifact precludes confident analysisRight ventricular systolic function appears mildly decreased. Left ventricularsystolic function grossly normalNo definite evidence of delayed enhancement imaging left ventricular musculatureto suggest myocardial scar or inflammationThis exam was performed and interpreted in conjunction with Dr. FrancoisMarcotte from the Department of Cardiovascular Diseases.

Mass has similar appearance and size when compared to CTA Chest of August 25, 2015.3. Given the small size of mass, CT (or echocardiogram) would be preferred modality for follow-up.4. Patent foramen ovale.FINDINGS:2.0 x 0.6 cm mass beginning at the patent foramen ovale and extending caudally to the end of the interatrial septum. Perfusion appears to be present. Delayed enhancement appears to be present which is suggestive of a cardiac myxoma rather than a thrombus (small size of mass limits sensitivity for delayed enhancement and perfusion).In retrospect, this mass was present on prior CT chest for pulmonary embolism dated 08/25/2015. Accounting for differences in technique, it does not appear changed in size between CT 08/25/2015, or transesophageal echocardiogram 01/22/2016. Given the masses small size, it would be best followed with serial CTs or echocardiograms.Electronically signed by:P. A.

There is one small 6 mm right supraclavicular lymph node which shows new mild hypermetabolism. This node appears slightly larger than on the previous exam. This could be due to reactive change or early metastasis. Consider ultrasound guided percutaneous needle biopsy of this node.#2. Thickening of the esophagus above and below the distal esophageal carcinoma site, with moderate hypermetabolism consistent with radiation therapy. Uptake at the site of the carcinoma itself has decreased as discussed below.#3. Otherwise negative for interval development of hypermetabolic metastasis.RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 18.0 mCi F-18 FDG i.v.CLINICAL INFORMATION: 72-year-old man with esophageal carcinoma, recently completed combined modality therapy.TECHNIQUE: Positron emission tomography of the TORSO from skull base to upper thighs was performed in this fasting, NONDIABETIC patient with a dedicated ring detector PET/CT scanner 60 minutes after radiopharmaceutical injection. Noncontrast CT was performed for attenuation correction and lesion localization. Automated, variable CT mA dose adjustment used. Glucometer blood glucose was 114 mg/dL prior to tracer injection.FINDINGS: Correlation is made with previous PET CT scan 04/15/2010.The maximum SUV at the site of esophageal carcinoma on the previous exam has decreased from 7.6 previously, to maximum SUV 5.4 today. The uptake is less focal today as well, and extends over a greater length of the esophagus, with at least some of this uptake attribute able to the effect of radiation.There is one small 6 mm right supraclavicular lymph node which shows mild hypermetabolism. This node appears slightly larger than on the previous exam.The mid to distal esophagus is thickwalled and shows circumferential hypermetabolism, probably corresponding to the region of irradiation. Mild uptake along tract of the jejunostomy tube. No abnormal uptake in the previously identified subcarinal lymph node. Distribution of radiopharmaceutical is otherwise within expected physiologic variation.Noncontrast CT localizer images are reviewed. The esophageal wall cephalad to the previously identified distal esophageal mass is more thickened today, probably a result of radiation. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly decreased on the left compared to 06/04/2010 CT, and slightly increased on the right. Punctate coronary calcifications. Azygos lobe and fissure. Right chest wall subcutaneous catheter with tip in SVC. Strandy atelectasis in the right lower lobe. The amount of parenchymal opacity in the subpleural left lingula has decreased slightly compared to the previous CT. This is probably an infarct related to prior pulmonary embolism seen on the CT 06/04/2010. Previously enlarged lymph nodes in the right paraesophageal area are less impressive today and are not hypermetabolic. No new lymphadenopathy. IVC filter. Bilateral parapelvic renal cysts. Pockets of gas in the right abdominal wall and left abdominal wall subcutaneous fat may be related to subcutaneous injections. Prostate moderately enlarged. Trace pelvic fluid.
