1. The report does not mention pulmonary embolism or any filling defects in the pulmonary arteries, which suggests that it is unlikely to be present.
2. There are no specific statements indicating its absence either, so we cannot conclude with certainty that it's absent.
3. However, considering there is no explicit mention of pulmonary embolism and other relevant findings like fractures and degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine, it seems reasonable to assume that pulmonary embolism was not a significant finding at the time of scan.

Approximately 1 cm posterior subluxation of C1 on C2. High density material within the dura anterior and posterior to the spinal cord may represent associated epidural hematoma. This in conjunction with prominent degenerative, partially calcified pannus at the atlantoaxial joint and fracture-related osseous deformity creates moderate to severe central canal narrowing at the level of C1-C2 with mild cord deformity (8:41). No additional fractures are identified. Advanced degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine with flowing anterior osteophytes from C4-T1 suggestive of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. There is reduction in cervical lordosis. Disc osteophyte complexes at C2-C3 and C3-C4 create mild-to-moderate central canal narrowing at both levels. Uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet degeneration create the following neural foraminal stenoses: Moderate bilateral at C2-C3, moderate to severe bilateral C3-C4, moderate bilateral at C4-C5, moderate bilateral at C5-C6, and moderate left at C7-T1.

CERVICAL SPINE: There is an avulsion fracture with a 3 mm avulsion fragment that is newly displaced at the anterior-inferior margin of the C4 vertebral body (series 8 image 41). There is mild surrounding soft tissue edema, without frank hematoma formation. When compared with cervical spine CT on 09/26/2018, there is minimal widening of the anterior C4-5 disc space, measuring 5 mm, previously 4 mm, which may represent anterior longitudinal ligament injury. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 on C5, which is unchanged compared to 09/26/2018. Advanced spondylotic changes of the cervical spine, with multilevel disc height loss and disc osteophyte complex formation, ligament flavum thickening, and bilateral facet arthropathy. There is multilevel spinal canal stenosis, most advanced at the C4-5 level, where there is marked ligamentum flavum thickening, similar in appearance compared to 09/26/2018. Multilevel neural foraminal narrowing that is mild to moderate at the bilateral C3-4, C4-5, left C6-7 levels and moderate to advanced at the right C6-7 level. Increased soft tissue density along the posterior spinal canal at the level of C1 which has progressed compared to 09/26/2018. THORACIC SPINE: No acute fracture or malalignment of the thoracic spine. Spondylosis of the thoracic spine, with intervertebral disc height loss and flowing anterior osteophyte complex formation throughout the thoracic spine (diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis). Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C7 on T1 and grade 1 anterolisthesis of T1 on T2. No significant spinal canal stenosis. Advanced neural foraminal narrowing at the bilateral T10-11 level. LUMBAR SPINE: No acute fracture malalignment of the lumbar spine. Chronic grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1, with bilateral L5 pars defects. Advanced spondylosis of the lumbar spine. L1 -2: Mild to moderate spinal canal stenosis and bilateral mild to moderate neural foraminal narrowing. Marked intervertebral disc height loss and posterior disc bulge. Moderate bilateral facet arthropathy L2-3: Mild-to-moderate spinal canal stenosis and bilateral mild-to-moderate neural foraminal narrowing. Marked intervertebral disc height loss and posterior disc bulge. Advanced bilateral facet arthropathy. L3-4: At least moderate spinal canal stenosis and bilateral moderate neural foraminal narrowing. Marked intervertebral disc height loss and posterior disc bulge. Advanced facet arthropathy. L4-5: No significant spinal canal stenosis. Mild-to-moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. Loss of the L4-5 disc space, with fusion of the vertebral bodies. Advanced facet arthropathy. L5-S1: Mild spinal canal narrowing. Moderate-advanced bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. Advanced disc height loss with minimal posterior disc bulge. Bilateral pars defects. Advanced facet arthropathy. For intrathoracic and intra-abdominal findings, see report for concurrently obtained CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis. IMPRESSION: 1. Minimally displaced avulsion fracture at the anterior margin of the inferior C4 vertebral body, with mild widening of the anterior C4-5 disc space, which may represent anterior longitudinal ligament injury. No acute injury of the thoracic or lumbar spine. 2. Increased soft tissue density along the posterior spinal canal at the level of C1 when compared with 09/26/2018, most likely ligamentum flavum thickening, less likely superimposed posttraumatic swelling or hematoma. No associated fracture seen at this level. 3.

Hardware is intact without evidence of fracture or loosening. Wire ligature at the C1-2 level is intact. No change in cervical alignment is observed. No cervical spine fractures are evident. Varying degrees of autofusion of the vertebral endplates identified at the C3-4 through C6-7 level. No central bony canal stenosis is observed. Note is made of autofusion of the posterior aspect of the atlantooccipital joint on the left and to a lesser extent along the posterior medial margin of the right atlantooccipital joint. This appears to correspond with some reactive marrow edema within the left occipital condyle on the prior MRI examination (MRI series 10 and 11 image 4). No foraminal compromise demonstrated at this level. Paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive postoperative changes of the cervical spine as previously described without evidence of fracture or hardware instability. 2.

Mild compression deformities of the superior endplates of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies, without fracture line evident. These are difficult to age at CT but may be chronic. No other fracture. Several millimeters of anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and mild anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and of C5 on C6. Advanced multilevel facet arthrosis. A central disc protrusion or extrusion at C3-4 contributes along with the spondylolisthesis and posterior ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding to spinal canal stenosis and probably moderate compression of the spinal cord. Ligamentous hypertrophy/infolding is notable also at a few other levels, particularly at C2-3. Neural foraminal stenosis is advanced at left C3-4 and moderate at right C3-4. On initial scanning, at the level of C3 to the inferior endplate of C4, there was apparent hyperdensity within the spinal canal, circumferentially about the cord (for example series 8, image 47). The patient was brought back for additional scanning given the indeterminate nature of the hyperdensity after discussion with Andrea Hlady, MD, PhD (pager #11001). On repeat imaging (series 15 and 19), the hyperdensity within the spinal canal has an appearance more compatible with ligamentous redundancy rather than epidural hematoma. Calcified atheromatous plaque both carotid bifurcations. The partially visualized lung apices are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute fracture or traumatic malalignment in the cervical spine. Multi-level mild to moderate vertebral subluxations are favored to be chronic. 2. Mild superior endplate compression fractures of the T1 and T2 vertebral bodies. Although their age is not entirely certain, they may be chronic. 3. Spinal canal stenosis at C3-4 should be degenerative in etiology, but there is associated spinal cord compression. The degree of this would be better evaluated with cervical spine MRI, if indicated.","Cervical Spine Fracture"

<prexplanaton>1. The report does not mention anything about glioma or brain tumors, so it is unlikely that the GliomaStatus would be mentioned.
2. Since there are no findings related to a glioma in this CT scan of the cervical spine, we cannot determine if the tumor is progressing, regressing, stable or showing pseudoprogression/pseudoresponse.
3. Therefore, our initial answer should remain ""Absent"" as it does not provide any information about GliomaStatus.

","EXAM: MR BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST COMPARISON: Prior brain MRI examinations dated 11/16/2022, 08/26/2022, 06/23/2022 and 05/10/2022 INDICATION: On 05/04/2022, a left suboccipital stereotactic biopsy confirmed diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered (CNS WHO grade 4). Radiation therapy completed 05/25/2022. Steroid therapy tapered to dexamethasone 1 mg QD on 10/07/2022. Left abducent palsy was again evident in October 2022, for which she initially received some steroids. Followup imaging here on November 16, 2022, confirmed tumor progression, and thus her second course of 10 fractions of radiation therapy was initiated on November 18, 2022, with completion in early December 2022. FINDINGS: Since the most recent prior examination of 11/16/2022, there has been substantial improvement in overall degree of expansion of the pons as well as spatial extent of T2 hyperintensity within the pons and superior medulla with slight interval decrease in size of the previously seen exophytic component arising from the left ventrolateral inferior pons. Overall appearance of the pons is now more similar to findings on the 08/26/2022 examination with similar appearance of the 4th ventricle which is less severely compressed than on the November exam. Previously seen prominent T1 hypointensity within the central pons noted on the November scan has resolved with the overall appearance on postcontrast T1-weighted images now appearing more similar to the August 26 examination with areas of subtle linear enhancement traversing the central and lateral pons. Overall dimensions of the mid pons as measured on image 10 series 5 at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncles is approximately 4.3 cm transverse by approximately 2.5 cm AP with comparable measurement on the earlier November scan measuring 4.6 cm transverse by 8.0 cm AP as measured on comparable anatomic image 9 of series 6 of the November scan. The change in the spatial extent of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity is most evident when comparing sagittal T2 FLAIR images slightly to the left of midline including the exophytic inferior pontine ventral component; maximal craniocaudal dimension of the T2 FLAIR signal abnormality measured approximately 3.1 cm on the November scan compared to only 1.6 cm on the current examination as measured on image 74 series 4 and approximately 1.8 cm on the August 26 examination. Stable postsurgical changes with hemosiderin staining biopsy tract again noted traversing the left cerebellar hemisphere and left middle cerebellar peduncle with termination in the left lateral aspect of the pons, where small cystic cavity is again noted. Remainder of the brain is unremarkable with no additional pathologic intracranial enhancement seen aside from stable appearing left medial frontal developmental venous anomaly. No diffusion restriction. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells as well as orbits are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Marked interval reduction in size of the expanded pons with interval reexpansion of the 4th ventricle, resolution of previously seen extensive T2 FLAIR hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity when compared to the most recent prior examination of 11/16/2022. Overall appearance of the pontine signal abnormality is now similar to the appearance on the 08/26/2022 examination, suggesting interval therapeutic response.","Glioma progression"

Status post radiation (7/2/2022-7/21/2022) with concurrent temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide. Bevacizumab initiated for radiation necrosis on 9/23/2022. Again seen is a diffuse predominantly nonenhancing T2 hyperintense tumor involving the left temporal lobe, left insula, left basal ganglia, bilateral thalamus (left significantly greater than right) and extending across the corpus callosum into the medial right temporal lobe. Since 10/20/2022, there has been further decrease in the size of the enhancing component located in the left lateral pons. T2 hyperintense signal in this region has also decreased. Elsewhere, the diffuse T2 hyperintense signal appears essentially unchanged in appearance and extent since the prior exam. Enhancing region in the left pons again appears to demonstrate increased perfusion and restricted diffusion, compatible with viable tumor. Left lateral ventricle and 3rd ventricle remain partially effaced by the expansile mass centered in the left thalamus. Ventricular calibers are stable. Minimal rightward midline shift is unchanged. Scattered bifrontal T2 hyperintense white matter foci are nonspecific, but may be treatment related. Unchanged periventricular T2 hyperintense signal. Changes related to prior stereotactic biopsy with adjacent pachymeningeal enhancement. Mild mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal sinuses. IMPRESSION: Enhancing tumor component in the left lateral pons has decreased in size since 10/20/2022, likely related to current Avastin therapy.

No new sites of FLAIR abnormality. Enhancement: Overall slight interval decrease in prominence of enhancement about the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle, anterior body right lateral ventricle, and right superior frontal gyrus.

FINDINGS: Redemonstration of the mixed cystic and predominantly solid enhancing suprasellar glioma. The enhancing components on today's exam measure approximately 2.8 x 3.4 x 3.7 cm (AP by LR by SI) compared to 3.1 x 3.3 x 4.0 cm previously when measured in the same planes. There is notably less superior extension of the mass into the region of the third ventricle compared to the prior study with the tumor no longer encroaching upon the region of the foramina of Monro. No hydrocephalus. Furthermore, the dominant cystic portion along the inferior right aspect of the lesion adjacent to the right M1 has significantly decreased in size now measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.8 cm (AP x LR x SI) compared to 1.5 x 1.5 x 2.2 cm previously. The intratumoral cysts have minimally decreased in size as well. The mass again insinuates about and slightly splays the major anterior circle of Willis vasculature with possible minimal narrowing of the A1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries. No high-grade arterial narrowing or loss of arterial flow voids. Similar distortion and stretching of the optic pathways in the hypothalamus. The pituitary is again noted distinct from the mass and lying within the sella with a normal intrinsic T1 hyperintense neurohypophysis. The infundibulum remains obscured. The mammary bodies are posteriorly displaced. Overall similar extension into the prepontine cistern with abutment of the upper basilar artery without associated narrowing. Stable linear focus of enhancement within the posterior medulla near the apex, likely vascular in nature. Similar vascular type linear enhancement along the surface of the ventral medulla. Tiny focus of linear enhancement within a inferior left frontal sulcus (series 800/image 120) is most likely vascular in nature. No convincing leptomeningeal or intraventricular dissemination. No abnormal restricted diffusion or hemosiderin deposition. Stable probable arachnoid cyst in the right cerebellar medullary angle. Prominent retropharyngeal lymph nodes, likely reactive. Scattered paranasal sinus mucosal thickening. IMPRESSION: Overall, there has been mild interval decrease in size in both the solid and cystic components of the suprasellar glioma. Most notably the dominant cystic component along the right M1 segment has markedly decreased in size. The overall mild decrease in size of the solid component results in mildly decreased superior extension into the ventral 3rd ventricle with notably less encroachment on the region of the foramina of Monroe.

FINDINGS: Abnormal exam with interval improvement. The previously identified predominantly expansile heterogeneously enhancing glioma in the left middle cerebellar peduncle has demonstrated interval steady decrease in size since previous examinations dating back to July 2022, currently measuring 2.1 cm AP by 2.4 cm transverse by 2.1 cm craniocaudal, compared to 2.7 cm AP by 3.2 cm transverse by 2.3 cm craniocaudal on September 21, 2022, and 3.2 cm AP by 3.9 cm transverse by 2.8 cm craniocaudal on July 5, 2022, when remeasured in a similar manner. There is persistent partial effacement of the fourth ventricle but this is slightly reexpanded since the previous examinations. There is persistent increased CBV perfusion corresponding to this mass lesion. Redemonstrated is previously stereotactic biopsy tract from left occipital bone approach, with susceptibility weighted signal loss compatible with blood metabolites along the biopsy tract at the biopsy site. There are persistent areas of unenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity with mild mass effect surrounding the enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere and in the vermis, which could represent areas of edematous change versus areas of subtle unenhancing infiltrative tumor. These findings are stable. The ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are otherwise normal in size, shape and position. Tiny focus of restricted diffusion is identified within the aforementioned mass lesion, but this could be related to blood metabolites (series 6, image 71). A small patchy focus of unenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity is identified in the periventricular white matter surrounding the left frontal horn extending into the left external/extreme capsule region (series 20, image 15), which is nonspecific but could represent a small focus of chronic demyelination or gliosis. Mild nodular mucosal thickening is present of the paranasal sinuses.
